# The Scriptures and their Commentaries

The word of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Vinaya as
taught by him, consists of nine divisions, which are Sutta, Geyya,
Veyyākaraṇa, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhuta and
Vedalla.[^8]

1. Sutta[^9] includes all Discourses, such as the
Mangala sutta (Good Discourse, “Minor Readings”, V), and also the Vinaya
Piṭaka[^10] and the “Niddesa”.

2. Geyya includes all suttas with verses (gāthā), such as
the Sagāthā-vagga of the “Saṃyutta Nikāya”, or “Kindred Sayings” (I).

3. Veyyākaraṇa, or “Exposition”, includes the Abhidhamma
Piṭaka, the suttas without verses and the words of the Buddha that are
not included in the other eight divisions.

4. Gāthā or “Verses” include the “Dhammapada”,
“Theragāthā”, “Therīgāthā” (“Psalms of the Brothers and Sisters”) and
those parts of the “Sutta-Nipāta” not called Sutta and entirely in
verse.

5. Udāna or “Verses of Uplift” include eighty-two suttas
connected with verses recited by the Buddha, inspired by knowledge and
joy.

6. Itivuttaka or “As it was said” includes one hundred ten
suttas[^11] beginning with “Thus it was said by the Blessed One”
(in Pāli: “Vuttaṃ h’etaṃ Bhagavatā”).

7. ātaka or Birth Stories include five hundred fifty
stories of the past lives of the Buddha and his disciples, beginning
with the Apaṇṇaka Jātaka.

8. Abbhuta, “Marvellous,” includes suttas connected with
wonderful and marvellous things (dhammas with extraordinary qualities,
which are amazing).

9. Vedalla includes suttas with questions and answers that
have as result understanding and delight, such as the Cullavedalla
sutta. 

The word of the Buddha consists of eighty-four thousand
units of text. The venerable Ānanda learnt eighty-two thousand units of
text from the Exalted One, and two thousand units of text from the
bhikkhus, mainly from the venerable Sāriputta. Each theme is one unit of
text. Thus, the sutta containing one theme is one unit of text. Where
there are questions and answers, each question forms one unit of text
and each answer forms one unit of text.

When the scriptures are classified as the Tipiṭaka, they
are classified as threefold, namely: the Vinaya, the Suttanta and the
Abhidhamma.

The Vinaya Piṭaka or “Books of Discipline” consist of
five Books, namely:

- “Mahāvibhaṅga”

- “Bhikkhunīvibhaṅga”

- “Mahāvagga” 

- “Cullavagga”

- “Parivāra”[^12]

The commentary that explains the Vinaya is the
“Samantapāsādikā”.[^13]

 The Suttanta Piṭaka, or Discourses, consists of five
Nikāyas,[^14] namely, “Dīgha Nikāya” or “Dialogues of the
Buddha,”[^15] “Majjhima Nikāya” or “Middle Length
Sayings,”[^16] “Saṃyutta Nikāya” or “Kindred
Sayings,”[^17] “Aṅguttara Nikāya” or “Gradual
Sayings,”[^18] “Khuddaka Nikāya” or “The Minor
Collection.”[^19]

The “Dīgha Nikāya” is a collection of long dialogues
(dīgha means long), consisting of thirty-four suttas. This collection is
divided into three sections (in Pāli: vagga):[^20]

- Sīla-kkhandha-vagga (sīla means morality and khandha means group);
 

- Mahā-vagga (mahā means great); 

- Pāṭika-vagga (called after the first sutta; Pāṭika is a proper
 name).

The commentary to this collection is the “Sumaṅgalavilāsinī”.

The “Majjhima Nikāya” is a collection of suttas of
medium length (majjhima means middle), and it consists of one hundred
fifty-two suttas. It is divided into three parts, which are called in
Pāli “paṇṇāsa,” meaning fifty. The first two parts consist of fifty
suttas each and the third part of fifty-two suttas. They are called:

- Mūla-paṇṇāsa (mūla means root), consisting of five sections of ten
 suttas;

- Majjhima-paṇṇāsa, consisting of five sections of ten suttas;

- Upari-paṇṇāsa (upari means above or later), consisting of five
 sections, of which four have ten suttas and the fifth has twelve
 suttas.

The commentary to this collection is the “Papañcasūdanī”.

The “Saṃyutta Nikāya” is a group of suttas (saṃyutta
means joined, connected) divided into five main divisions, namely:

- Sagāthā-vagga (gāthā means verse, with verses), with eleven
 sections;

- Nidāna-vagga (nidāna means origin or cause), consisting of nine
 sections;

- Khandha-vagga (dealing with the five khandhas), consisting of
 thirteen sections;

- Saḷāyatana-vagga (saḷāyatana is the sixfold āyatana or sense
 spheres), consisting of ten sections;

- Mahā-vagga (great chapter), consisting of twelve sections.

The commentary to this collection is the “Sāratthappakāsinī”.

The “Aṅguttara Nikāya” consists of suttas grouped
according to the numbers of Dhamma subjects or points dealt with. They
are arranged in order, from one to eleven. Thus, there are eleven
“nipāta,” or sections in all. “Book of the Ones” consists of suttas
dealing with one kind of subject, and so on up to the Book of the
Elevens. Summarizing them, they are:

- Eka-nipāta (eka means one), Book of the Ones;

- Duka-nipāta (duka, from dve, two, meaning pair), Book of the Twos;

- Tika-nipāta, Book of the Threes;

- Catuka-nipāta, Book of the Fours;

- Pañcaka-nipāta, Book of the Fives;

- Chaka-nipāta, Book of the Sixes;

- Sattaka-nipāta, Book of the Sevens;

- Aṭṭhaka-nipāta, Book of the Eights;

- Navaka-nipāta, Book of the Nines;

- Dasaka-nipāta, Book of the Tens;

- Ekādasaka-nipāta, Book of the Elevens.

The commentary to the “Aṅguttara Nikāya” is the “Manorathapūranī”.

Apart from these four Nikāyas, there is the “Khuddaka
Nikāya”, which contains the word of the Buddha. This consists of the
following books:

- “Khuddakapāṭha” or “Minor Readings”;[^21]
- “Dhammapada” (pada means word or phrase);[^22]
- “Udāna” or “Verses of Uplift”;

- “Itivuttaka” or “As it was said”;

- “Suttanipāta” or “The Group of Discourses”;

- “Vimānavatthu” or “Stories of the Mansions” (in “Minor Anthologies
 IV”);

- “Petavatthu” or “Stories of the Departed” (in “Minor Anthologies
 IV”);

- “Theragāthā” or “Psalms of the Brethren”;

- “Therīgāthā” or “Psalms of the Sisters”;

- “Jātaka” or “Stories of the Buddha’s Former Births” (in three
 volumes by P.T.S.);

- “Mahā-Niddesa” (niddesa means descriptive exposition);

 III”).

The commentaries to these collections of the “Khuddaka
Nikāya” are the following:

- The “Paramatthajotikā”, which is the commentary to the
 “Khuddaka-pātha” and the “Suttanipāta”;[^25] 
- “Dhammapadaṭṭhakathā” or “Buddhist Legends” (in three volumes by
 the P.T.S.), which is the commentary to the “Dhammapada”;

- The “Paramatthadīpanī”, which is the commentary to the “Udāna”,
 the “Itivuttaka”, the “Petavatthu”, the “Theragāthā”, the
 “Therīgāthā”, the “Cariyāpiṭaka” and the “Vimānavatthu”;[^26]

 (P.T.S.), which is the commentary to the “Buddhavaṃsa”.

The Abhidhamma Piṭaka consists of the following seven
Books:

- “Dhammasaṅgaṇī” (translated by PTS as “Buddhist Psychological
 Ethics,” and also translated by U Kyaw Khine) and this has as
 commentary the “Aṭṭhasālinī” (“The Expositor”);

- “Vibhaṅga” or “The Book of Analysis,” which has as commentary the
 “Sammohavinodanī” or “Dispeller of Delusion”;[^28] 
- “Dhātukathā” or “Discourse on Elements”;

- “Puggalapaññatti” or “a Designation of Human Types”; 

- “Kathāvatthu” or “Points of Controversy”; 

- “Yamaka”;[^29] 
- “Paṭṭhāna” or “Conditional Relations”.[^30] 

As to the commentary to the last five Books of the Abhidhamma, this is
the “Pañcappakaraṇatthakathā”.[^31]

The greater part of the commentaries to the Tipiṭaka is
from the hand of the great commentator Buddhaghosa.[^32] He
translated into Pāli, compiled and arranged material from the ancient
commentaries, which were in Sinhalese. These commentaries, the
“Mahā-Atthakathā”, the “Mahā-Paccarī” and the “Kuruṇḍi”, stemmed from
the time of the Thera Mahinda, the son of the great King Asoka who came
to Sri Lanka in order to propagate Buddhism. 

Furthermore, there are sub-commentaries, called ṭīkā in
Pāli, which explain the commentaries. These are the “Sāratthadīpanī”, a
sub-commentary to the “Samantapāsādikā”, which is the commentary to the
Vinaya; the “Sārattha Mañjūsā”, a sub-commentary to the Suttanta Piṭaka,
the “Paramatthapakāsinī”, a sub-commentary to the Abhidhamma Piṭaka; and
the anuṭīkā (anu meaning: along, alongside), which explains words and
expressions in the sub-commentaries. Apart from the aforementioned
works, there are several other texts in Buddhism needed for the study of
the Dhamma that were composed by the “Elders”[^33] who were
qualified to pass on the tradition of the Dhamma. These are the
following texts:

- “Milindapañha” or “Milinda’s Questions,”[^34] composed
 about 500 Buddhist Era (43 B.C.);
- “Visuddhimagga” or “Path of Purification,”[^35] an
 Encyclopedia on Buddhism, composed by Buddhaghosa about 1000 B.E.
 (457 A.D.);
- “Abhidhammattha Saṅgaha” or “A Manual of Abhidhamma,”[^36]
 composed by Ven. Anuruddha about 1000 B.E. (457 A.D.);[^37]

- “Mangalattha Dīpanī”, an explanation of the Mangala sutta (Good
