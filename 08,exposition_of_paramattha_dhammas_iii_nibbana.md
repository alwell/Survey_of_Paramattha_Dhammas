# Exposition of Paramattha Dhammas III (Nibbāna)


Nibbāna paramattha dhamma is another kind of paramattha
dhamma. The Buddha called it “nibbāna,” because it is the end of “vāna,”
which means craving.[^70] The paramattha dhamma that is nibbāna
is the cessation of dukkha. Citta, cetasika and rūpa are dukkha, because
they are impermanent, they arise and then fall away. Desire should be
eradicated so that there can be an end to dukkha. Desire is the origin,
the cause of the arising of dukkha. It is the cause of the arising of
the five khandhas, which are citta, cetasika and rūpa.[^71]
Desire can be eradicated by developing paññā, wisdom, so that the
characteristics of the arising and falling away of citta, cetasika and
rūpa are penetrated. When paññā has been developed to the degree that
nibbāna can be realized and clearly known, clinging and wrong view with
regard to citta, cetasika and rūpa can be eradicated. Nibbāna is the
dhamma that is the cessation of dukkha and the cessation of the
khandhas.[^72] Nibbāna is reality, it is a paramattha dhamma, an
ultimate reality and it is a dhamma that can be clearly known. 

Nibbāna paramattha dhamma[^73] has been
classified as twofold:

- sa-upādisesa nibbāna dhātu, nibbāna with the khandhas remaining;
 

- an-upādisesa nibbāna dhātu, nibbāna without the
 khandhas.[^74]



“Upādi” in “upādisesa” is another designation of the
five khandhas, which include citta, cetasika and rūpa. As to “nibbāna
with the khandhas remaining,” this means that all defilements have been
eradicated, but that the khandhas remain, arising and falling away in
succession. As to “nibbāna without the khandhas remaining,” this means
the final falling away of the five khandhas, not to arise again, that
is, the parinibbāna, the final passing away, of an arahat. 

Thus, two kinds of nibbāna have been
proclaimed.[^75] 

When the Buddha attained enlightenment under the
Bodhi-tree, he attained nibbāna with the khandhas remaining,
sa-upādisesa nibbāna dhātu. He completely eradicated defilements and all
the dhammas (citta and cetasikas) accompanying defilements, so that they
could never arise again. However, the khandhas were still remaining,
namely, citta, cetasika (which were without defilements) and rūpa,
arising and falling away in succession. 

We read in “As it was said” (“Minor Anthologies”, As it
was said, the Twos, Ch. II, VII) that the Buddha said to the monks:

“Of what sort, monks, is nibbāna with the basis still remaining? Herein,
monks, a monk is arahat, one who has destroyed the cankers
(defilements), who has lived the life, done what was to be done, laid
down the burden, won the goal, worn out the fetter of becoming, one
released by perfect knowledge. In him the five sense faculties still
remain, through which, as they have not yet departed, he experiences
pleasant and unpleasant objects, undergoes pleasure and pain. The end of
attachment, aversion and ignorance of that monk, is called, monks, the
element of nibbāna with the basis still remaining.”

 An-upādisesa nibbāna is nibbāna without the khandhas
remaining. When the Buddha, between the twin Sal trees, attained
parinibbāna, his final passing away,[^76] this was an-upādisesa
nibbāna, the final falling away of the khandhas. Citta, cetasika and
rūpa fell away for good, never to arise again. This was the cessation of
rebirth, the end of the cycle of birth and death. 

There are four stages of attaining enlightenment and at
each of these stages defilements are eradicated. The sotāpanna
(stream-winner, who has attained the first stage of enlightenment), the
sakadāgāmī (once-returner, who has attained the second stage of
enlightenment), and the anāgāmī (non-returner, who has attained the
third stage of enlightenment) are “learners” (sekha), because they have
to continue to develop higher degrees of paññā in order to eradicate the
defilements which are still remaining. The arahat is a “non-learner”
(asekha), because he has eradicated all defilements completely, he has
reached perfection and does not need to develop higher degrees of paññā
any longer. 

Nibbāna paramattha dhamma can be classified according to
three characteristics:

- voidness, suññatta, 

- signlessness, animitta, 

- desirelessness, appaṇihita. 



Nibbāna is called voidness, suññatta, because it is
devoid of all conditioned realities (saṅkhāra dhammas). It is called
signlessness, animitta, because it is void of “signs” of conditioned
realities. It is called desirelessness, appaṇihita, because it is
without any basis of desire, namely, conditioned realities. 

When someone has developed paññā to the degree that he
is about to attain enlightenment, he may penetrate the dhammas that
appear at those moments as impermanent, as dukkha, or as anattā. Only
one of these three general characteristics can be realized at a time.
When he attains nibbāna, his way of emancipation is different depending
on which of the three general characteristics of conditioned dhammas he
has realized in the process during which enlightenment is attained. When
he realizes dhammas that appear as impermanent, he becomes liberated
(realizes the four noble Truths) by the emancipation of signlessness
(animitta vimokkha).[^77] When he realizes dhammas as dukkha, he
becomes liberated by the emancipation of desirelessness (appaṇihita
vimokkha).[^78] When he realizes dhammas as anattā, non-self, he
becomes liberated by the emancipation of voidness (suññatta
vimokkha).[^79]

With regard to these three ways of emancipation,
vimokkha, four different aspects can be discerned:[^80]

- By predominance – when someone realizes dhammas as impermanent,
 signlessness emancipation, animitta vimokkha, is predominant. When
 he realizes dhammas as dukkha, desirelessness emancipation,
 appaṇihita vimokkha, is predominant. When he realizes dhammas as
 anattā, voidness emancipation, suññatta vimokkha, is predominant. 

- By steadfastness – when someone realizes dhammas as impermanent,
 the citta is steadfast by signlessness emancipation. When he
 realizes dhammas as dukkha, the citta is steadfast by desirelessness
 emancipation. When he realizes dhammas as anattā, the citta is
 steadfast by voidness emancipation. 

- By inclination – when someone realizes dhammas as impermanent, the
 citta is guided by the inclination to signlessness emancipation.
 When he realizes dhammas as dukkha, the citta is guided by the
 inclination to desirelessness emancipation. When he realizes dhammas
 as anattā, the citta is guided by the inclination to voidness
 emancipation. 

- By the way of being led unto nibbāna – when someone realizes the
 aspect of impermanence, the citta is being led unto nibbāna,
 cessation, by the influence of signless emancipation. When he
 realizes the aspect of dukkha, the citta is being led unto nibbāna
 by the influence of desirelessness emancipation. When he realizes
 the aspect of anattā, the citta is being led unto nibbāna by the
 influence of voidness emancipation.
