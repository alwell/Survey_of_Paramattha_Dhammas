# Different Aspects of the Four Paramattha Dhammas


Citta, cetasika, rūpa and nibbāna are paramattha
dhammas; they are reality. Citta, cetasika and rūpa, which arise and
fall away in succession, present themselves so that they can be
cognized, and thus it can be known that they are reality. For example,
when we see colour, hear sound or think, cittas arise and fall away in
succession, performing different functions. Some cittas see colour,
others hear sound, and others again are thinking, depending on the type
of citta and the conditions which cause its arising. The sequences of
citta, cetasika and rūpa are extremely rapid and that is why we do not
notice the arising and falling away. People may erroneously believe that
rūpa gradually changes and that citta arises when a person or other
living being is born, that the same citta lasts during life and falls
away only when that person or being dies. 

If we do not study and investigate the Dhamma, and not
develop sati, mindfulness, and paññā, understanding, in order to
penetrate the characteristics of citta, cetasika and rūpa, then we shall
always be ignorant of the true nature of nāma dhamma and rūpa dhamma, of
citta, cetasika and rūpa that arise and fall away in succession, all the
time.

The dhammas that arise can do so because there are
conditioning factors for their arising. They cannot arise without
conditions. The venerable Sāriputta gained confidence in the teachings
of the Buddha when he met the venerable Assaji, one of the monks from
the group of the first five disciples of the Buddha. The venerable
Sāriputta was so impressed by the venerable Assaji’s comportment that he
followed him, asking him who his preceptor was and what his preceptor
was teaching. The venerable Assaji answered:[^81]

“Ye dhammā hetuppabhavā tesaṃ hetuṃ Tathāgato āha, tesañ ca yo nirodho,
evaṃvādī Mahāsamaṇo ti.”

This means:

“Those things (dhammas) which proceed from a cause, of these the
Truth-finder has told the cause. And that which is their stopping – the
great recluse has such a doctrine.”

If the Buddha had not taught about the dhammas and the
ways they are conditioned, as he had realized through his enlightenment,
there would be no one who would know which dhamma arises from what
conditions. There would be no one who would know the dhammas that are
the conditions for the arising of each type of citta paramattha dhamma,
cetasika paramattha dhamma and rūpa paramattha dhamma. The Buddha had,
through his enlightenment, penetrated the true nature of all dhammas. He
taught that all dhammas that arise do so because of appropriate
conditions, and he also taught which conditions bring about the arising
of dhammas. Dhammas cannot arise without conditions. 

We say of people, of other living beings, or devas, that
they are born; but in reality, citta, cetasika and rūpa are born. When a
specific type of citta accompanied by cetasikas arises together with
rūpa we say in conventional language that a person is born. When citta
and cetasikas arise with the rūpa of a deva (a being from a heavenly
plane), we say that a deva is born. People, other living beings and
devas have different kinds of births because the conditions for their
births are different. The conditions that cause different births are
numerous and they are most intricate. However, the Buddha, when he
attained enlightenment, penetrated by his omniscience the true nature of
all dhammas as well as all the different factors that are the conditions
for their arising. He taught the true nature of each dhamma and he
explained that whatever dhamma arises has conditions for its arising.

The dhammas that arise are saṅkhāra dhammas, conditioned
dhammas. We know that there are citta, cetasika and rūpa, because they
arise, and they arise because of the appropriate conditions. Hence,
citta, cetasika and rūpa are saṅkhāra dhammas.[^82] 

The Buddha’s teaching is complete as to the letter and
meaning. But, he gave further explanations of Dhamma subjects, whose
meaning people might misunderstand. He added words that described the
meaning, making it even clearer. People might have misunderstandings
about saṅkhāra dhamma, dhammas which arise because of conditions: they
might mistakenly believe that dhammas that arise could continue to
exist. Hence, the Buddha taught that saṅkhāra dhammas are also saṅkhata
dhammas,[^83] dhammas that have already been conditioned and then
fall away.[^84] The Buddha used the term saṅkhata dhamma in
addition to saṅkhāra dhamma in order to explain that a dhamma that
arises has conditions for its arising and that when the conditions fall
away, that dhamma, which has arisen because of conditions, also must
fall away. Saṅkhata dhamma is the dhamma that has been conditioned and
then falls away. Hence, saṅkhāra dhamma, the dhamma that is compounded
by conditioning factors, is also saṅkhata dhamma.[^85] The
paramattha dhammas, which are citta, cetasika and rūpa, are saṅkhāra
dhamma as well as saṅkhata dhamma and they have the following
characteristics:

- Sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā - All conditioned dhammas are impermanent. 

- Sabbe saṅkhāra dukkha - All conditioned dhammas are dukkha.

- Sabbe dhammā anattā - All dhammas are non-self.[^86] 



### All Saṅkhāra Dhammas are Impermanent



All conditioned dhammas are impermanent. The decay and
impermanence of rūpa dhamma are apparent but the impermanence of nāma
dhamma is hard to notice. We read in the “Kindred Sayings” (II,
Nidāna-vagga, XII, the Kindred Sayings on Cause, 7, the Great Chapter
§61, The Untaught) that the Buddha, while he was staying near Sāvatthī,
at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park, said to the monks: 

“The untaught many folk, monks, might well be repelled by this body,
where the four great Elements come together, they might cease to fancy
it and wish to be free from it. Why so? Seen is the growth and decay of
this body, where the four great Elements come together, the taking on
(at birth) and laying down of it (at death). Hence well might the many
folk be repelled by it, cease to fancy it and wish to be free from it.

Yet this, monks, what we call thought, what we call mind, what we call
consciousness (citta), by this the untaught many folk are not able to
feel repelled, they are not able to cease fancying it or to be freed
from it. Why so? For many a long day, monks, has it been for the
uninstructed many folk that to which they cling, that which they call
‘mine’, that which they wrongly conceive, thinking - that is mine, this
I am, this is myself. Hence the untaught many folk are not able to feel
repelled by it, are not able to cease fancying it, are not able to be
freed from it...But as to this, monks, what we call thought, what we
call mind, what we call consciousness: one citta arises when another
perishes, day and night.”

Although citta, cetasika and rūpa arise and fall away
all the time, it is hard to understand this and to become detached, to
eliminate clinging to nāma and rūpa. Nāma and rūpa must be investigated
and understood by paññā so that clinging can be eliminated. We read in
the “Dhammapada” vs. 277-280 (“Minor Anthologies”) that the Buddha said:

“ ‘All saṅkhāra dhammas are impermanent’, when one discerns this with
wisdom, one turns away from dukkha; this is the Path to purity.

‘All saṅkhāra dhammas are dukkha’, when one discerns this with wisdom,
one turns away from dukkha; this is the Path to purity.

‘All dhammas are non-self (anattā)’, when one discerns this with
wisdom, one turns away from dukkha; this is the Path to purity.”

If one does not realize the arising and falling away of
nāma dhammas and rūpa dhammas in order to eliminate clinging to wrong
view, one cannot penetrate the four noble Truths and become an ariyan, a
“noble person” who has attained enlightenment. The ariyan understands
the meaning of “awakening” or Buddhahood, the Buddha’s enlightenment. He
understands this not merely by theoretical knowledge of the dhammas the
Buddha taught, but by direct understanding of the dhammas the Buddha had
penetrated by his enlightenment. The ariyan has eradicated all doubt
concerning the dhammas the Buddha had penetrated, because the ariyan has
realized those dhammas himself.[^87] The ariyan has realized the
meaning of “Buddhahood” because by attaining enlightenment he has
penetrated himself the true nature of the dhammas the Buddha taught. The
person who understands and sees the Dhamma, sees the
Tathāgata.[^88] The person who studies the Dhamma and practises
the Dhamma in order to penetrate the true nature of realities can attain
enlightenment and eradicate defilements. But this depends on the stage
of enlightenment he has attained, be it the stage of the “stream-winner”
(sotāpanna), the “once-returner” (sakadāgāmī), the “non-returner”
(anāgāmī) or the arahat.[^89]



### All Saṅkhāra Dhammas are Dukkha



All saṅkhāra dhammas, conditioned realities, arise and
then fall away, be it wholesome citta or unwholesome citta, be it rūpa
that is beautiful or rūpa that is ugly, they all arise and fall away
alike. The arising and falling away of realities, their impermanence,
means dukkha, unsatisfactoriness. The nature of dukkha inherent in all
saṅkhāra dhammas is not merely dukkha, suffering, in the sense of bodily
pain, illness or tribulations, or suffering caused by separation from
what we like and association of what we dislike. The nature of dukkha
inherent in all saṅkhāra dhammas is their impermanence; when they have
arisen they fall away and thus they should not be taken for happiness.
Some people may wonder why all saṅkhāra dhammas are dukkha, why even the
citta that experiences happiness and enjoys pleasant objects is dukkha.
The citta that experiences happiness does not last and thus it is
dukkha. All saṅkhāra dhammas, citta, cetasika and rūpa, are dukkha
because they are impermanent, they do not last. 



### All Dhammas are Anattā



All dhammas are anattā. All four paramattha dhammas,
citta, cetasika, rūpa and nibbāna are anattā. They are not self; they
are not under anyone’s control. 

Nibbāna is paramattha dhamma; it is reality. Nibbāna is
not saṅkhāra dhamma, it is visaṅkhāra dhamma,[^90] unconditioned
dhamma. Nibbāna is the dhamma that does not arise,[^91] it is the
opposite of saṅkhāra dhamma. Saṅkhāra dhamma is the dhamma that arises
because of conditions whereas visaṅkhāra dhamma is the dhamma that does
not arise, that is unconditioned. 

Nibbāna is asaṅkhata dhamma, the dhamma that is not
saṅkhata.[^92] Saṅkhata dhamma is the dhamma that arises and
falls away whereas asaṅkhata dhamma is the dhamma that does not arise
and fall away. Nibbāna is not conditioned, and, thus, it does not arise
and fall away.

Citta, cetasika and rūpa, which are saṅkhāra dhammas,
are lokiya, “mundane.” They are susceptible to destruction.[^93]
Nibbāna, which is visaṅkhāra dhamma or asaṅkhata dhamma, is lokuttara.
The word lokuttara means beyond the world, supramundane, free from the
world.[^94] 

Summarizing the paramattha dhammas, they are:

- nāma dhamma which knows an object: 

citta paramattha, 89 or 121 cittas;

cetasika paramattha, 52 cetasikas

- rūpa dhamma: 

rūpa paramattha, 28 rūpas;

- nāma dhamma which does not know an object: 

nibbāna paramattha. 



The Five Khandhas

The five khandhas, groups or aggregates, comprise: 

- rūpakkhandha (all rūpas), 

- vedanākkhandha (feelings), 

- saññākkhandha (remembrance or perception), 

- saṅkhārakkandha (all cetasikas, except feeling and remembrance),
 

- viññāṇakkhandha (all cittas).[^95] 



Paramattha Dhammas and Khandhas

- Citta is viññāṇakkhandha. 

- Cetasika is vedanākkhandha, saññākkhandha, saṅkhārakkhandha. 

- Rūpa is rūpakkhandha. 

- Nibbāna is not khandha. It is freedom from khandha (khandha
 vimutti). 



The term khandha refers to the dhamma that can be
described as past, future or present, internal or external, gross or
subtle, inferior or superior, far or near. Hence, khandha is saṅkhata
dhamma, the dhamma that is conditioned, which arises and falls away, and
thus, it can be described as past, present, future, etc. Whereas
asaṅkhata dhamma, nibbāna, is the dhamma that does not arise, that is
unconditioned.[^96] It cannot be said of nibbāna that it has
arisen, that it has not yet arisen, or that it will arise. It cannot be
described as past, future or present. Therefore, visaṅkhāra dhamma,
nibbāna, is not khandha, it is freedom from khandha (khandha vimutti). 

We read in the “Kindred Sayings” (III, Khandhā-vagga,
First Fifty, Ch 5, §48, The Factors) that the Buddha, while he was at
Sāvatthī, explained to the monks about the five khandhas and the five
upādāna khandhas, khandhas of grasping:

“I will teach you, monks, the five khandhas and the five khandhas that
have to do with grasping. Do you listen to it.

And what, monks, are the five khandhas?

Any rūpa, be it past, future or present, inward or outward, gross or
subtle, inferior or superior, far or near – that is called rūpakkhandha.
Any feeling, any perception, any group of ‘activities’ (or ‘formations’,
saṅkhārakkhandha), any consciousness, be it past, future or present,
inward or outward, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near,
that is called viññāṇakkhandha. These five, monks, are called the five
khandhas.

And what, monks, are the five khandhas that have to do with grasping
(upādāna khandhas)? Any rūpa, monks, be it past, future or present...be
it far or near, goes together with the āsavas (intoxicants)[^97],
and is a condition for upādāna, grasping. That is called khandha of
grasping, upādāna khandha. Any feeling...any perception...any group of
“activities”...any consciousness, monks, be it past, future or
present...be it far or near, goes together with the āsavas, and is a
condition for upādāna, grasping. These are called the five upadāna
khandhas.”



The Three Paramattha Dhammas classified as Five Khandhas

Citta Paramattha Dhamma - all 89 (or 121) types are:   
Viññāṇakkhandha.

Cetasika Paramattha Dhamma - 52 types: 

    vedanā cetasika is:      
    Vedanākkhandha,

    saññā cetasika is:       
     Saññākkhandha,

    50 cetasikas are:       
     Saṅkhārakkhandha.

Rūpa Paramattha Dhamma - all 28 types are: Rūpakkhandha.

- Rūpakkhandha is: Rūpa Paramattha Dhamma (28
rūpas).

- Vedanākkhandha is: Cetasika Paramattha Dhamma (vedanā).
