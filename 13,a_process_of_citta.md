# A Process of Citta



As we read in the “Atthasālinī” (I, Book I, Part II, §
63) about citta:

>  “...Or, inasmuch as this word citta is common to all states or classes
of citta, that which is known as mundane: kusala, akusala or
mahā-kiriya, is termed ‘citta’, because it arranges itself (cināti) in
its own series or continuity by way of javana (impulsion), in a process
of citta.”

 In order to understand the aspect of citta as that
which arranges itself in its own series or continuity by way of javana,
we should remember that cittas arise and fall away, succeeding one
another very rapidly, and that wholesome and unwholesome qualities,
cetasikas, which accompany a citta and fall away with the citta, are
accumulated from one moment of citta to the next moment of citta.

When citta arises and sees what appears through the
eyes, hears sound through the ears or experiences another sense object,
it is usually not known that such experiences are a characteristic of
citta. We are more likely to notice citta when it is unhappy, sad or
annoyed, when it is happy or pleased, when there is citta with anger or
loving-kindness, when there is the inclination to help someone else or
to treat him with affection. Each citta that arises and falls away very
rapidly is succeeded by the next citta and therefore the accumulations
of the preceding citta are going on to the following citta. Whether the
citta is kusala citta or akusala citta, each citta that arises and falls
away conditions the next citta, which immediately succeeds it. That is
why inclinations accumulated in the preceding citta can go on to the
next citta, and so it continues all the time. 

We can notice that everybody has different inclinations,
a different character, and this is so because all the different
inclinations have been accumulated in the citta, and these are going on
from one citta to the next. Some people are inclined to perform
wholesome deeds. They are able to do so because kusala citta that in the
past arose and fell away, was succeeded by the next citta that
accumulated the inclination toward wholesomeness. Thus, conditions have
been created for the arising of kusala citta later on. It is the same in
the case of akusala citta, be it akusala citta rooted in attachment, in
aversion or in ignorance. When the akusala citta falls away, it
conditions the arising of the succeeding citta and thus the inclination
to akusala accumulated in the preceding citta goes on to the next citta,
and in this way, there are conditions for the arising of akusala citta
in the future. 

The fact that cittas succeed one another is due to
contiguity-condition, anantara-paccaya: each citta is anantara-paccaya
for the next citta. This means that the preceding citta conditions the
arising of the next citta, which immediately succeeds it, as soon as the
preceding citta has fallen away. Each citta is anantara-paccaya for the
succeeding one, except the dying-consciousness (cuti-citta) of the
arahat. This citta cannot be anantara-paccaya, because when it has
fallen away parinibbāna, the final passing away of the khandhas, occurs.
Therefore, the dying-consciousness of the arahat is not succeeded by
rebirth-consciousness nor by any other citta. 

Summarizing the conditions that were already dealt with,
they are three:

- conascence-condition – sahajāta-paccaya,

- object-condition – ārammaṇa-paccaya, 

- contiguity-condition – anantara-paccaya. 

To repeat the “Atthasālinī” about the second aspect of
citta:

> “...Or, inasmuch as this word ‘citta’ is common to all states or classes
of citta, that which is known as mundane: kusala, akusala or
mahā-kiriya, is termed citta, because it arranges itself (cināti) in its
own series or continuity, by way of javana, in a process of citta.”

This seems rather complicated, but it refers to
realities in daily life. People may have heard time and again the words
kusala citta and akusala citta, but they may not be familiar with the
terms “mundane,” “mahā-kiriyacitta” and with the term “javana in a
process.” 

All the different types of citta can be classified by
way of four jātis or categories (jāti meaning birth or nature): 

- kusala citta, 

- akusala citta, 

- vipākacitta, 

- kiriyacitta. 



Kusala citta is the citta that is wholesome, it is the
cause that will produce pleasant result, kusala vipāka, in the future.
When kusala citta and the accompanying cetasikas, which are the cause of
a future result, have fallen away, the accumulated wholesome qualities
of that citta go on to the next citta and again to the following ones.
Thus, they are a condition for the arising of kusala vipākacitta and the
accompanying cetasikas in the future; they are the result of the kusala
citta which formerly arose. It has been explained in the commentary that
the cetasikas that accompany the vipākacitta are vipāka cetasikas, but
since citta is the “leader” the word vipākacitta is used; the
accompanying cetasikas are also vipāka. 

Another example where the word citta also refers to the
accompanying cetasikas is the term “cittaja rūpa,” the rūpa that
originates from citta. In fact, cittaja rūpa arises because citta and
the accompanying cetasikas are the condition for its arising. Thus, the
word cittaja rūpa also refers to the accompanying cetasikas that
condition the arising of that rūpa. In the same way, the word
vipākacitta also refers to the accompanying vipāka cetasikas.

Akusala citta is a reality that is harmful and
dangerous. It causes the arising of unhappy, unpleasant result in the
form of different kinds of akusala vipākacittas. 

Apart from kusala citta, akusala citta and vipākacitta,
there is another class of citta, and this is kiriyacitta, inoperative
citta. Kiriyacitta is neither kusala citta nor akusala citta, and,
therefore, it is not a cause for the arising of vipākacitta. Nor is it
vipākacitta, the result of kusala citta or akusala citta. As we have
seen, all cittas can be classified by the four jātis of kusala, akusala,
vipāka and kiriya.

If we do not study realities in detail, we shall not
know when citta is kusala, when akusala, when vipāka and when kiriya.
The rebirth-consciousness, paṭisandhi-citta, is the first citta that has
arisen in this lifespan. We all are alive at this moment because the
rebirth-consciousness has arisen in this lifespan and it conditions us
to be a particular individual. The rebirth-consciousness is neither
kusala nor akusala; when it arises it cannot commit any kamma (action)
through body, speech or mind. The rebirth-consciousness is vipākacitta;
it arises because it is conditioned by a particular kamma. No matter how
numerous the kammas may have been which were performed in each of our
lifespans, whichever of these kammas conditions the arising of the
rebirth-consciousness or any other type of vipākacitta, that kamma is
kamma-condition, kamma-paccaya, for the rebirth-consciousness or the
other types of vipākacitta. If someone is born in the human plane of
existence, which is a happy plane, that birth must be the result of
kusala kamma. In such a case, the rebirth-consciousness is kusala
vipāka. If one is born in an unhappy plane, a hell plane, as a ghost
(peta), as an asura (demon) or as an animal, it is the result of akusala
kamma. The rebirth-consciousness that arises in an unhappy plane is
akusala vipāka.

A kamma that was formerly committed conditions the
arising of the rebirth-consciousness, the first citta of this life,
which immediately succeeds the dying-consciousness of the previous life.
After the rebirth-consciousness has fallen away, the same kamma is the
condition for the arising of the next vipākacittas, which perform the
function of life-continuum, bhavanga. The bhavanga-citta maintains the
continuation in the life of someone as a particular person. It performs
its function throughout life, in between the processes of cittas, until
the dying-consciousness arises and one passes away from life in this
plane of existence. Then there is no longer this particular person in
this lifespan. In the course of life, other kammas can be the condition
for the arising of different vipākacittas, which experience objects
through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue and the bodysense.

Kusala is the reality that is good, wholesome,
blameless, not harmful. Some people think that they can only perform
kusala if they are rich and are able to spend money, but they forget
that one can be generous and give assistance in other ways. Even if
someone does not have much money, he may still have some things he can
share with others in order to help them. Can one give assistance to
others? If one cannot do this, is that kusala or akusala? If someone
with few means does not know that kusala citta is the citta that is
good, wholesome and faultless, he will perhaps be unhappy and believe
that he cannot perform deeds of merit. But there are actually many other
kinds of kusala, apart from donations of money, one can perform. One can
have loving-kindness towards someone else. Then one treats him as a
fellow human being and the citta is tender and gentle; one can utter
affectionate, amiable speech that comes from one’s heart. There are
always ways and means to give assistance to others and share things with
them. At such moments the citta is kusala citta, it is a dhamma that is
faultless, which cannot cause any harm or danger. 

When there is conceit and someone thinks himself more
important, superior or more clever than someone else, when he compares
himself with someone else and thinks in terms of “he” and “I,” there
cannot be kusala citta arising. At such moments one cannot help others,
there cannot be any giving or sharing; instead there is akusala citta,
the dhamma that is unwholesome and harmful.

If we really understand the characteristic of kusala we
shall find ways and means to develop many different kinds of kusala.
However, if a person wants to keep things for himself he is unable to be
generous. He may have desire for calm, or he may be attached to the idea
of eradicating defilements and becoming a sotāpanna, but he is unable to
give something away to someone else.

Each person has accumulated inclinations for different
kinds of kusala and akusala. We should consider and investigate our own
citta and find out whether there is still a great deal of stinginess, or
whether we can gradually begin to give away useful things to others. In
that way, generosity can become our nature, it can even become a
powerful condition, a support for paññā, which eliminates the wrong view
that takes nāma and rūpa for self. When paññā has been developed, it can
become so keen that nibbāna can be realized. 

We may believe that we want to be without defilements,
but when defilements actually arise, it seems that we wish to have them.
We may have conceit, we may find ourselves important or we may be
jealous. Someone else may say that such defilements should be
eradicated, that one should rejoice in someone else’s happiness or that
one should have loving-kindness towards a disagreeable person, but are
we able to follow such advice? People who want to be angry, who want to
have contempt for others, who want to be arrogant or jealous, cannot
follow the advice to cultivate wholesomeness. This shows that the
eradication of defilements cannot occur immediately, that it can only be
accomplished very gradually. Paññā can gradually be developed so that it
can arise from time to time. If we really want to eradicate defilements,
we should know that all kinds of kusala should be developed. It is not
right to just perform dāna, generosity, and pay no attention to the
defilements which still arise. It is essential to know one’s
defilements.

A person may just want to be calm because he often feels
restless and disturbed. Because of his thoughts, he is angry or
confused, and there seem to be circumstances that make him feel worried
or annoyed all the time. The reason is that at such moments he does not
examine his own citta, but instead pays attention only to those he is
angry with. If one pays attention to other people in an unwholesome way,
so that akusala citta arises, the citta will be disturbed, restless and
worried. A person may notice when he is upset and then he just wants to
be calm. But he fails to see that when there is no anger he will not be
disturbed, whereas when there is anger, he is unhappy and disturbed.
When one is angry and disturbed, there is akusala citta, the dhamma that
is harmful.

If we can be mindful after we have been angry, and we
can then think of others in such a way that loving-kindness, compassion,
sympathetic joy or equanimity arises, there will immediately be
calmness. When loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy or
equanimity accompanies the citta, it is kusala citta, without
attachment, aversion and ignorance; and then it is calm. There is true
calmness with each kusala citta. Thus, if we want to eradicate
defilements we should develop all kinds of kusala, not merely
generosity, dāna. 

Repeating again the “Atthasālinī” with regard to the
second aspect of citta:

> “...that which is known as mundane: kusala, akusala and mahā-kiriya, is
termed citta, because it arranges itself in its own series or
continuity, by way of javana, in a process of citta.”

The word “series” or “continuity”, in Pāli “santāna,”
refers to the arising and falling away of cittas in succession, in their
own series. The citta that sees, hears, smells, tastes or experiences
tangible object is vipākacitta, not kusala citta or akusala citta.
Therefore, these cittas are not javana-cittas which arise and fall away
in their own series in the process of cittas.[^114] Vipākacittas
are results of past kammas. When a deed or kamma has ripened and it is
ready to produce result, and there are also other conditioning factors
that play their part, vipākacitta can arise. There are different kinds
of vipākacitta that perform different functions, such as seeing or
hearing. Vipākacitta does not arise in the succession of javana, it is
result produced by kusala kamma or akusala kamma that has been
accumulated and is therefore the condition for the arising of vipāka.
Vipākacitta that arises and then falls away cannot cause the arising of
any other vipākacitta. 

We should have right understanding of the second aspect
of citta, that kusala cittas, akusala cittas and mahā-kiriyacittas
arrange themselves in their own series or continuity by way of javana,
in the process of cittas. First of all, we have to know what cittas
arising in a process, vīthi-cittas, are, which types of cittas they are
and when they arise. Javana cittas in a process are a succession or
series of kusala cittas or akusala cittas. For the arahat there is,
instead of kusala citta or akusala citta, mahā-kiriyacitta performing
the function of javana.[^115] Also, the arahat has different
types of cittas that condition the movement of the body, which condition
speech and which think, arising in the series of javana-cittas.

We should first of all know that vīthi-cittas, cittas
arising in a process, are not rebirth-consciousness, bhavanga-citta or
dying-consciousness. All types of cittas other than these are
vīthi-cittas. The rebirth-consciousness arises only once in a life span.
It succeeds the dying-consciousness of the previous life and it only
performs the function of rebirth. At that moment, there is no seeing,
hearing, smelling, tasting or the experience of tangible object.
Rebirth-consciousness is vipākacitta, the result of kamma. The
rebirth-consciousness that arises in the human plane of existence is
kusala vipākacitta, the result of kusala kamma.

Kamma not only produces the rebirth-consciousness as
result. When the rebirth-consciousness has fallen away, kamma also
conditions the arising of the succeeding citta which is the same type of
vipākacitta and performs the function of bhavanga, life-continuum. As we
have seen, this type of citta maintains the continuation in the life
span of someone as a particular person until death. So long as the
dying-consciousness has not arisen yet, the bhavanga-cittas that arise
and fall away perform the function of preserving the continuity in one’s
life. They perform their function at the moments when there is no
seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, the experiencing of tangible object
or thinking. Thus, the rebirth-consciousness, the bhavanga-citta and the
dying-consciousness are cittas that do not arise in processes; they are
not vīthi-cittas.

When we are fast asleep, we do not see or experience
other sense objects, we do not think. The bhavanga-cittas arise and fall
away in succession all the time, until we dream or wake up, and there is
again seeing, hearing, the experience of other sense objects or thinking
of different subjects of this world. This world does not appear to the
rebirth-consciousness, the bhavanga-citta and the dying-consciousness.
At the moment the vipākacitta arises and performs the function of
rebirth or the function of bhavanga, the different objects of this
world, in our case the human world, do not appear. If we would be fast
asleep at this moment, we would not know anything, we would not see
anyone who is here. We would not experience sound, odour, cold or heat.
The bhavanga-citta is not involved with anything in this world. It does
not even know who we are, where we are, who are our relatives and
friends. It does not know anything about possessions, rank, an
honourable position, happiness or misery. Whereas when we are not asleep
we remember the things of this world, the different people and the
different stories connected with this world.

When we see, there is no bhavanga-citta, but vīthi-citta
instead, which arises and sees what appears through the eyes. The citta
which sees, the citta which knows what the object is that is seen, the
citta which likes what appears through the eyes, the cittas which
experience objects through the ears, the nose, the tongue, the bodysense
or the mind-door, are all vīthi-cittas. When we hear a sound and then
like it or dislike it, there are no bhavanga-cittas, but vīthi-cittas
instead. 

All the cittas that arise and experience visible object
which appears through the eyes, are eye-door process cittas,
cakkhu-dvāra vīthi-cittas. There are vīthi-cittas that are ear-door
process cittas, nose-door process cittas, tongue-door process cittas,
body-door process cittas and mind-door process cittas, all of which
experience an object through the corresponding doorway. 

The nāma dhammas that naturally occur in our daily life
are bhavanga-cittas arising and falling away as well as vīthi-cittas
that arise and experience an object through one of the six doors.
Successions of bhavanga-cittas and vīthi-cittas arise alternately. 

When one is born in a five-khandha plane (where there
are nāma and rūpa), kamma conditions the arising of kammaja rūpa (rūpa
produced by kamma). These are, among others, the rūpas that are
eyesense, earsense, smelling-sense, tasting-sense and bodysense. These
rūpas arise and fall away in succession. They provide one with the
ability to experience sense objects, thus, they prevent one from being
blind, deaf or disabled. However, when kamma at a particular moment no
longer conditions the arising of, for example, the rūpa which is
eyesense, one will be blind, one will not be able to see anything at
all. Thus, the citta which sees and the other sense-cognitions are each
dependent on the appropriate conditions which cause their arising. 

So long as vīthi-cittas do not arise yet,
bhavanga-cittas are arising and falling away in succession. When a rūpa
that can be sense object arises and impinges on the corresponding
sense-base (pasāda rūpa), vīthi-cittas cannot arise immediately. First,
bhavanga-cittas arise and fall away before sense-door process cittas
arise, which can experience that rūpa. 

Rūpa arises and falls away very rapidly, but citta
arises and falls away faster than rūpa. The time one rūpa arises and
falls away is equal to the time seventeen cittas arise and fall away.
When a rūpa impinges on a sense-base there are, as we have seen, some
bhavanga-cittas arising and falling away first. The first
bhavanga-citta, which arises when that rūpa impinges on the sense-base,
is called atīta-bhavanga, past bhavanga. This bhavanga-citta is of the
same type as the bhavanga-cittas that arose before. The name atīta
bhavanga is used to point out how long the rūpa that impinges on the
sense-base will last so that it can be experienced by vīthi-cittas.
Counting from the atīta bhavanga, it cannot last longer than seventeen
moments of citta.

When the atīta bhavanga has fallen away, it conditions
the succeeding bhavanga-citta, which “vibrates,” and which is stirred by
the object, so it is called bhavanga calana, vibrating
bhavanga.[^116] This citta is still bhavanga-citta, since
vīthi-citta cannot arise yet and the stream of bhavanga-cittas still
continues. When the bhavanga calana has fallen away, the succeeding
bhavanga-citta arises, and this is the bhavangupaccheda, arrest
bhavanga, which interrupts the stream of bhavanga-cittas, because it is
the last bhavanga-citta before vīthi-cittas arise. When the
bhavangupaccheda has fallen away, vīthi-cittas arise and experience the
object that appears through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue,
the bodysense or the mind-door. 

All vīthi-cittas that experience visible object through
the eyes are eye-door process cittas, cakkhu-dvāra vīthi-cittas, because
they experience a visible object that impinges on the eyesense, but has
not yet fallen away. 

All vīthi-cittas that experience sound through the ears
are ear-door process cittas, sota-dvāra vīthi-cittas, because they
experience sound, which impinges on the ear-sense and has not yet fallen
away. It is the same in the case of the vīthi-cittas that experience
objects through the other doorways; they are named after the relevant
doorway. 

Vīthi-cittas of the mind-door process, mano-dvāra
vīthi-cittas, can experience all kinds of objects. When the mind-door
process follows upon a sense-door process, the vīthi-cittas of the
mind-door process experience visible object, sound, odour, flavour or
tangible object that were experienced by the vīthi-cittas of the five
sense-door processes. The vīthi-cittas of the mind-door process can also
experience dhammārammaṇa, mind-object, which is an object that can be
experienced only through the mind-door.
