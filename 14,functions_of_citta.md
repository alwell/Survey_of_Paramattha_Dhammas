# Functions of Citta


Citta can experience objects through the six doors. All
objects that can be experienced by citta can be classified as sixfold:

1. Visible object, rūpārammaṇa, can be known by citta through the
 eye-door and through the mind-door. 

2. Sound, saddārammaṇa, can be known by citta through the ear-door
 and through the mind-door. 

3. Odour, gandhārammaṇa, can be known by citta through the nose-door
 and through the mind-door. 

4. Flavour, rasārammaṇa, can be known by citta through the
 tongue-door and through the mind-door. 

5. Tangible object, phoṭṭhabbārammaṇa, can be known by citta through
 the body-door and through the mind-door. 

6. Mental object, dhammārammaṇa, can be known by citta only through
 the mind-door. 



The cittas arising in the mind-door process, mano-dvāra
vīthi-cittas, can experience all six classes of objects. As regards
mental object, dhammārammaṇa, this can be known only by mind-door
process cittas.

Each citta that arises performs a function and then it
falls away. The rebirth-consciousness, which succeeds the
dying-consciousness of the previous life, performs the function of
rebirth only once. After that citta has fallen away, bhavanga-cittas
arise and all bhavanga-cittas, including the past bhavanga, atīta
bhavanga, the vibrating bhavanga, bhavanga calana, and the arrest
bhavanga, bhavangupaccheda, perform the function of bhavanga; they
preserve the continuity in a lifespan. The bhavangupaccheda is the last
bhavanga-citta arising before the stream of bhavanga-cittas is arrested
and a series of cittas arising in a process occurs. The bhavangupaccheda
is succeeded by the first citta of a process, a vīthi-citta. This citta
performs the function of adverting, āvajjana; it pays attention to or
adverts to the object that appears through one of the doorways. It does
not take part in the succession of bhavanga-cittas, but it turns towards
the object that impinges on one of the senses. If the object impinges on
the eyesense, the five-sense-door adverting-consciousness, the
pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta, arises and performs the function of adverting
through the eye-door. If the object impinges on one of the other senses,
the five-sense-door adverting-consciousness performs the function of
adverting to the object through the relevant doorway. It experiences the
object which contacts one of the five sense-doors, but it does not see,
hear, smell, taste yet, and there is no body-consciousness yet. If the
object contacts the mind-door, not one of the five senses, the mind-door
adverting-consciousness, the manodvārāvajjana-citta, arises. This is
another type of citta that is different from the five-sense-door
adverting-consciousness. It performs the function of adverting to the
object only through the mind-door. 

During the arising and falling away of bhavanga-cittas,
flavour, for example, may arise and impinge on the rūpa which is
tasting-sense (jivhāppasāda rūpa). The atīta bhavanga, past bhavanga,
arises and falls away and is succeeded by the bhavanga calana, vibrating
bhavanga, and this again is succeeded by the bhavangupaccheda, the
arrest bhavanga. The bhavangupaccheda is succeeded by the
five-sense-door adverting-consciousness. This citta attends to the
object, it knows that the object impinges on the tongue-door but it
cannot taste yet. It is as if one knows that a visitor has arrived at
the door but one does not see him yet and does not know who he is.

We all have guests who come to see us. When we think of
guests, we are likely to think of people, but in reality our guests are
the different objects that appear through the eyes, the ears, the nose,
the tongue, the bodysense and the mind-door. When we see visible object
that appears through the eyes, visible object is our visitor. When we
hear sound, sound is our visitor. When we do not hear, sound does not
appear, and thus, a visitor has not come yet through the ear-door. When
flavour appears, flavour is like a visitor, it appears through the door
of the tongue just for a moment and then it disappears. Whenever an
object appears through one of the doorways, that object can be seen as a
visitor who comes through that doorway. It is there just for an
extremely short moment and then it disappears completely, it does not
come back again in the cycle of birth and death.

Elderly people tend to feel lonely when they lack
company. When they were younger they met many people, they enjoyed the
company of relatives and friends. When they have become older, the
number of visitors, whom they see as people, has dwindled. When one asks
elderly people what they like most of all, they will usually answer that
they like most of all the company of people. They are happy when other
people come to see them, they like to be engaged in conversation.
However, in reality everybody has visitors, at each moment one sees,
hears, smells, tastes or experiences tangible object. Usually when such
visitors come, citta rooted in attachment arises and enjoys what appears
through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue or the bodysense.

There are different kinds of visitors. Nobody would like
a wicked person as visitor, but a dear relative or friend is most
welcome. In reality, the different objects that appear through the
senses are only rūpas. Rūpa does not know anything and therefore it
cannot have any evil intention towards anybody. When would a visitor be
an enemy and when a dear relative or friend? Actually, when an object
appears and one enjoys it and clings to it, there is an enemy, because
enjoyment with clinging is akusala dhamma. Akusala dhamma is not a
friend to anybody. Whereas kusala dhamma is like a close relative who is
ready to help one, eager to give assistance at all times. Therefore, we
should know the difference between the characteristics of kusala citta
and of akusala citta.

Akusala citta is evil, harmful, it is like an enemy, not
a friend. When we think of an enemy we may be afraid, and we do not like
his company. However, it is akusala citta that is wicked, it is a
condition for creating an enemy in the future. Whereas, kusala citta,
which is like a dear relative or friend, is a condition for a dear
relative or friend to come in the future.[^117]

Rūpa is not a condition for foe or friend, because rūpa
does not know anything, it has no evil or good intentions. The sound
that appears is a reality that does not experience anything, it has no
wish for anybody to hear or not hear it. Sound is rūpa that arises
because there are conditions for its arising. The kind of sound that
will impinge on someone’s earsense is dependent on conditions. When we
are fast sleep, we do not even hear the deafening, frightening sound of
thunder. Then the sound of thunder is not our visitor. However, it can
be someone else’s visitor when the accumulated conditions, which cause
the earsense to be impinged upon by that sound, are there. It is
dependent on conditions whether an object will be someone’s visitor
through the doorway of eyes, ears, nose, tongue or bodysense. Kamma that
has been accumulated causes the arising of vipākacitta, which
experiences an object through one of the sense-doors. 

Thus, the visitors that present themselves through the
eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue and the bodysense are visible
object, sound, odour, flavour and tangible object. They appear just for
a moment and then they fall away, they disappear, not to return again.
There is no living being, person, self or anything there. Nobody knows
in a day which visitor will come through which doorway and at which
moment.

Whenever citta experiences an object through the eyes,
the other senses or the mind-door, it is vīthi-citta, citta arising in a
process. The five-sense-door adverting-consciousness, which succeeds the
bhavangupaccheda, is the first vīthi-citta in a sense-door process. This
citta performs the function of adverting to the object. It merely knows
that an object is impinging on one of the five sense-doors. Thus, it is
different from the citta that performs the function of seeing or from
the other sense-cognitions. If the five-sense-door
adverting-consciousness had not arisen and fallen away first, the other
vīthi-cittas of that sense-door process could not arise, be it a process
of the doorway of the eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue or the
bodysense. 

Thus, the five-sense-door adverting-consciousness is the
first vīthi-citta in a sense-door process and it adverts to the object
through one of the five sense-doors. Therefore, it is called
five-sense-door adverting-consciousness,
pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta,[^118] and is named after the
corresponding doorway, as the case may be. When it adverts to visible
object through the eye-door, it is called eye-door
adverting-consciousness, cakkhu-dvārāvajjana-citta. In the same way, the
adverting-consciousness that adverts to the object through each of the
other sense-doors is called ear-door adverting-consciousness, nose-door
adverting-consciousness, tongue-door adverting-consciousness and
body-door adverting-consciousness. However, the collective name
five-sense-door adverting-consciousness can also be used for this type
of citta, since it performs the function of adverting through all five
sense-doors.

There is also a type of citta that is the first
vīthi-citta of the mind-door process that experiences different objects
through the mind-door. Before kusala cittas or akusala cittas in a
mind-door process arise that may think of different subjects, there must
be a citta that performs the function of adverting to the object that
contacts the mind-door. This citta, which is the mind-door
adverting-consciousness, mano-dvārāvajjana-citta, is the first
vīthi-citta of the mind-door process. If this citta does not arise, the
next vīthi-cittas that experience an object through the mind-door cannot
arise. The mind-door adverting-consciousness is different from the
five-sense-door adverting-consciousness. The five-sense-door
adverting-consciousness can arise only in the five-sense-door processes,
not in a mind-door process. The mind-door adverting-consciousness can
perform the function of adverting only through the mind-door.

Thus, there are two types of vīthi-cittas that perform
the function of adverting: the five-sense-door adverting-consciousness,
which performs the function of adverting through the five sense-doors,
and the mind-door adverting-consciousness, which performs the function
of adverting only through the mind-door.

One may wonder whether a five-sense-door
adverting-consciousness is arising at this very moment. There must be,
otherwise there could not be seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or the
experiencing of tangible object. There is also at this moment mind-door
adverting-consciousness. Different vīthi-cittas arise which experience
an object through one of the five sense-doors and then they fall away.
When the sense-door process is over, there are many bhavanga-cittas
arising in succession, and then vīthi-cittas of a mind-door process
arise which again experience the same object as the vīthi-cittas of the
preceding sense-door process. They experience this object through the
mind-door, which is the citta preceding the mind-door
adverting-consciousness, the bhavangupaccheda, arrest
bhavanga.[^119] 

When we are fast sleep, we do not experience any object
through one of the six doors. The five-sense-door
adverting-consciousness or the mind-door adverting-consciousness cannot
arise at that time. Also, when we are not asleep there are moments that
we do not experience any object through one of the six doors. At such
moments, the five-sense-door adverting-consciousness or the mind-door
adverting-consciousness do not arise, but there are bhavanga-cittas
arising in between the different processes of cittas. 

In the five-sense-door process there are seven different
types of vīthi-cittas arising in a fixed order. When the first
vīthi-citta, the five-sense-door adverting-consciousness, has arisen,
has performed the function of adverting to the object and has fallen
away, it conditions the arising of the second vīthi-citta. In the case
of the eye-door process, seeing-consciousness (cakkhu-viññāṇa) arises
and performs the function of seeing (dassana kicca) just once and then
it falls away. It is the same in the case of the other sense-door
processes: hearing-consciousness, smelling-consciousness,
tasting-consciousness and body-consciousness, which arise, perform their
function just once and then fall away. Types of citta other than the
five sense-cognitions cannot succeed the five-sense-door
adverting-consciousness. 

The five-sense-door adverting-consciousness is the first
vīthi-citta. Seeing-consciousness, or one of the other sense-cognitions,
is the second vīthi-citta in the process. When the second vīthi-citta
has fallen away, it is succeeded by the third vīthi-citta, which is the
receiving-consciousness, the sampaṭicchana-citta. This citta performs
the function of sampaṭicchana; it receives the object from one of the
sense-cognitions. When the sampaṭicchana-citta has fallen away, the
fourth vīthi-citta arises, the investigating-consciousness,
santīraṇa-citta. This citta performs the function of investigating, it
investigates the object just once and then it falls away. The fifth
vīthi-citta is the determining-consciousness, votthapana-citta. This is
actually the same type of citta that is the mind-door
adverting-consciousness, mano-dvārāvajjana-citta. But, in the
five-sense-door process, it performs the function of determining the
object and it is then called after its function,
determining-consciousness, votthapana-citta. It determines whether
kusala citta, akusala citta or mahā-kiriyacitta will succeed it. It
prepares the way for these types of cittas. 

When the determining-consciousness, the
votthapana-citta, has fallen away, the sixth type of vīthi-citta arises,
and this can be kusala citta, akusala citta or mahā-kiriyacitta. There
are different types of kusala cittas, of akusala cittas and of
mahā-kiriyacittas, and when the series of javana cittas occurs, these
cittas are all of the same type of kusala citta, of akusala citta or of
mahā-kiriyacitta. They perform the function of javana,
impulsion,[^120] “running through” the object. As has been
stated, this type of citta “arranges itself in its own series or
continuity by way of javana.” 

All the types of vīthi-cittas that experience an object
through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the body-sense or the
mind-door arise in a fixed sequence. This fixed order of cittas (citta
niyāma) takes its course according to conditions and no one has any
power or control over this fixed order.

It is because of the appropriate conditions that first
the vīthi-citta, which is the five-sense-door adverting-consciousness,
arises, performs its function only once and falls away. The second type
of vīthi-citta of the sense-door process, which is in the case of the
eye-door process seeing-consciousness, arises and performs the function
of seeing only once and then it falls away. The third type of
vīthi-citta, the receiving-consciousness, sampaṭicchana-citta, arises
once and then falls away. The fourth type of vīthi-citta, the
investigating-consciousness, santīraṇa-citta, arises only once. The
fifth type of vīthi-citta, the determining-consciousness,
votthapana-citta, arises only once. The sixth type of vīthi-citta, which
may be kusala citta, akusala citta or mahā-kiriyacitta, performs the
function of impulsion, javana, and this function is performed seven
times by seven javana-cittas arising in succession. It is according to
conditions that the javana vīthi-citta arranges itself in its own series
or sequence. Conditions also determine that this type of vīthi-citta
arises and falls away seven times in succession. 

For those who are not arahats, the citta that performs
the function of javana is kusala citta or akusala citta. For the arahat
there are no kusala cittas or akusala cittas, but there are
mahā-kiriyacittas that can perform the function of javana. For the
arahat there are only cittas of the jātis (classes) of vipāka and
kiriya. There are several types of kiriyacittas. After seeing, hearing,
smelling, tasting, the experiencing of tangible object and also while
thinking, the javana-cittas of the arahat are “mundane” kiriyacittas. At
such moments, the citta experiences visible object, sound, odour,
flavour and tangible object, objects which are “the world.”

After a single moment of seeing, we enjoy what we have
seen and then akusala citta rooted in attachment arises seven times.
Thus, akusala citta arises seven times more often than
seeing-consciousness, which sees only once. In this way, akusala is
actually accumulated in daily life, and this concerns all of us. Because
of the persistent accumulation of akusala, the eradication of
defilements is extremely difficult, it cannot be achieved without right
understanding of realities. If someone believes that it is easy to
eradicate defilements, he should learn the truth about the process of
accumulation, the accumulation of ignorance, attachment, aversion and of
all the other faults and vices. One should know that defilements arise
seven times more often than seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and
body-consciousness, the types of citta that arise only once. If someone
has expectations and if he is wondering when he will penetrate the four
noble Truths, he does not take into account cause and effect, as they
really are, he does not consider the conditioning factors that have been
accumulated in the cycle of birth and death. We should develop right
understanding of the characteristics of all kinds of realities in order
to know them as they are. Then we shall penetrate the four noble Truths
and defilements can be eradicated stage by stage.

When we are listening to the Dhamma or studying the
subject of citta, and sati of satipaṭṭhāna can be aware of the realities
as they are, we are following the right practice. This means that we are
developing the way eventually leading to the realization of nibbāna, the
reality that is the cessation of defilements. Whenever sati is not aware
of the characteristics of realities as they appear, one does not develop
the way leading to the eradication of defilements, even if kusala dhamma
arises. 

The “Atthasālinī” states (I, Book I, Part I, Ch I,
Triplets in the Mātikā, 44) that akusala dhamma as well as kusala dhamma
that are not of the Eightfold Path,[^121] are leading to
accumulation, to the continuation of the cycle of birth and death. We
read about akusala and kusala that are not of the Path:

“Leading to accumulation (ācayagāmin)’ are ‘those states which go about
severally, arranging (births and deaths in) a round of destiny like a
bricklayer who arranges bricks, layer by layer, in a wall.”

Whenever we are not aware of the characteristics of
realities when they appear, and we do not understand them as they are,
no matter whether akusala dhamma or kusala dhamma presents itself, we
accumulate and build up life after life, just like the bricklayer who
piles up bricks one by one until they become a wall. However, when sati
is aware of the characteristics of realities that appear as they really
are, this is the Path, it is dispersion (apācayagāmin)[^122],
because then one does not build up dhammas that lead to accumulation,
just as a man tears down the bricks that the bricklayer has piled up.
Are we at this moment like the man who knocks down the bricks, or are we
like the man who piles them up? 

The first vīthi-citta is the five-sense-door
adverting-consciousness; the second vīthi-citta, one of the
sense-cognitions (pañca-viññāṇas); the third vīthi-citta,
receiving-consciousness; the fourth vīthi-citta,
investigating-conscious-ness; the fifth vīthi-citta,
determining-consciousness. These do not arise in their own series,
because there is only one citta of each type that arises and then falls
away. Even though the determining-consciousness, votthapana-citta, can
arise two or three times when the rūpa that is the object falls away
before the javana-citta arises,[^123] it cannot be said that the
votthapana-citta arises in its own series, like the javana-cittas.

It is only the sixth type of vīthi-citta, the
javana-citta, which arranges itself in its own series or continuity,
because there are usually seven cittas of this type arising and falling
away in succession. When one loses consciousness, the javana-cittas
arise and fall away six times in succession, and just before dying they
arise and fall away five times in succession. Since the javana-cittas
arise and fall away up to seven times in succession, they arise more
frequently than the other types of vīthi-cittas. Therefore, it is said
that the javana vīthi-citta arranges itself in its own series or
sequence.
