# The Ephemeral Experience of Objects


There are eighty-nine types of citta in all and these
can be classified by way of four jātis (jāti being nature of citta):

    - Kusala: 21 types of citta
    - Akusala: 12 types of citta
    - Vipāka: 36 types of citta
    - Kiriya: 20 types of citta


When we study the classification of citta by way of
jāti, we should know which types of citta arise for the ordinary person
(putthujana) and which types for the ariyan (a person who has attained
enlightenment):

- The ordinary person has cittas of four jātis: kusala, akusala,
 vipāka and kiriya. 

- The sotāpanna (stream-winner, who has attained the first stage of
 enlightenment) has cittas of the four jātis. 

- The sakadāgāmī (once-returner, who has attained the second stage
 of enlightenment) has cittas of the four jātis. 

- The anāgāmī (non-returner, who has attained the third stage of
 enlightenment) has cittas of the four jātis. 

- The arahat (the perfected one, who has attained the fourth stage
 of enlightenment) has cittas of two jātis: vipāka and kiriya.



We should not only know the jāti of a particular citta,
we should also know the function of that citta. The
rebirth-consciousness is vipākacitta, the result of kamma. The citta
that performs the function of rebirth in a happy plane is kusala vipāka,
the result of kusala kamma. The citta that performs the function of
rebirth in an unhappy plane, such as a hell plane, is akusala vipāka,
the result of akusala kamma. Not every kusala vipākacitta and akusala
vipākacitta perform the function of rebirth. Only the kusala vipākacitta
and the akusala vipākacitta that perform the function of rebirth are
called rebirth-consciousness.

The kusala vipākacitta or akusala vipākacitta that
performs the function of bhavanga (life-continuum) is called
bhavanga-citta.

Seeing-consciousness is a vipākacitta that cannot
perform the function of rebirth or the function of bhavanga. It can only
perform the function of seeing. It is called seeing-consciousness,
because it is the citta that clearly knows visible object, it sees the
object appearing through the eyes. Thus, we can understand that cittas
that clearly know an object through one of the different doorways are
named after the function they perform. 

Questioner: Why are there not five jātis of citta
instead of four, namely, kusala, akusala, kusala vipāka, akusala vipāka
and kiriya?

Sujin: You are wondering why there are not five jātis.
There are two jātis of cittas that are cause: kusala and akusala, and
therefore, you think that there should also be two jātis of cittas that
are result: kusala vipāka and akusala vipāka. In that case, there would
be five jātis. However, there are only four jātis, because vipāka is
mere result, it cannot be called inferior, medium or superior, as is the
case with kamma.[^136] Kusala citta and akusala citta, the
cittas that are cause, have many varieties. They are of different shades
and degrees, examples of which I shall give below. 

Kusala citta and akusala citta are different because of
the accompanying kusala dhammas or akusala dhammas when experiencing an
object through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the bodysense
and the mind-door. They are diverse since they can motivate different
types of kamma, good deeds and bad deeds. There is kamma of the level of
dāna, generosity, sīla, morality and mental development, bhāvana, which
includes the development of calm, samatha, through which defilements are
subdued, and the development of paññā. The development of paññā has many
degrees, such as listening to the Dhamma, explaining the Dhamma or the
development of satipaṭṭhāna, which is the development of insight,
vipassanā.

Kammas are different since they are performed through
body, speech or mind. They are accompanied by different cetasikas and
they have different predominant factors.[^137] Thus, we see that
the realities that are cause, kusala and akusala, are of great
diversity, that they have many shades and degrees, whereas vipākacittas
do not have such variety. Vipāka is only result of kamma that has been
performed already. When kamma has ripened and the right opportunity is
there, which conditions it to produce its result, vipākacitta arises.
Vipākacitta can perform the functions of rebirth, bhavanga or other
functions: it can experience different objects through the eyes, the
ears, the nose, the tongue, the bodysense or the mind-door. 

Seeing at this moment is vipākacitta; it has arisen
because it is conditioned by kamma performed in the past. But the
vipākacitta that sees cannot be a cause producing again vipāka.

When hearing-consciousness experiences sound, there is
vipākacitta, but hearing-consciousness cannot be a cause producing
vipāka. Thus, vipākacitta is not cause; it does not produce result. It
is incapable of performing deeds through body or speech. It cannot be
accompanied by cetasikas that are the wholesome qualities of compassion,
sympathetic joy or the three abstinences (virati cetasikas) of right
speech, right action and right livelihood.[^138] 

Vipākacitta itself is not a dhamma that is inferior,
medium or superior, but kamma that is inferior, medium or superior
produces its result accordingly and therefore, there are different
degrees of vipāka. Since vipāka is not a cause, producing result, but
only the result of a cause, of kusala kamma or of akusala kamma, there
is only one jāti that is vipāka. As we have seen, vipāka does not have
such diversity as the dhamma that is cause, namely, kusala and akusala,
which are classified as two different jātis. This is the answer to your
question.

All vipākacittas are result of kamma that has been
performed in the past. There are four types of vipākacittas arising in
the eye-door process: 

- Seeing-consciousness,
- Receiving-consciousness,
- Investigating-consciousness,
- Registering-consciousness (retention, tadārammaṇa). 



We should know when there is vipākacitta, kusala citta,
akusala citta or kiriyacitta. When we see a pleasant visible object,
seeing-consciousness is kusala vipāka. The receiving-consciousness, the
investigating-consciousness and the registering-consciousness that
follow are also kusala vipāka. After the visible object and the
vīthi-cittas of the eye-door process have fallen away, bhavanga-cittas
arise and fall away in succession, until vīthi-cittas arise again and
know another object that presents itself. We should remember that when
seeing-consciousness sees visible object through the eyes, that
seeing-consciousness, as well as the other vipākacittas in that process,
are the result of kamma that has been performed in the past.

When we hear a sound, which may be pleasant or
unpleasant, it is only one moment of vipāka vīthi-citta that hears the
sound and then falls away completely. However, there are conditions for
a great number of akusala cittas that like or dislike the rūpas that are
appearing through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue or the
bodysense. Like and dislike are never lacking in daily life, they arise
time and again on account of what appears through the six doors. 

Through theoretical understanding, acquired from
listening to the Dhamma the Buddha taught, akusala cannot be eradicated.
We may know that seeing is only vipāka, the result of kamma performed in
the past, but just knowing this in theory is not sufficient. Through
theoretical knowledge alone we cannot prevent the arising of attachment,
lobha, as soon as we see something pleasant. 

We should study realities so that right understanding
can develop to the degree that it can see the true nature of realities,
that it can see them as not a living being, not a person, not self. When
we study the Dhamma and carefully consider it in all details, we shall
more and more see the danger of akusala and we shall be inclined to
develop all levels of kusala. We should know that if we do not develop
kusala, we shall become ever more entangled by defilements.

We may believe that everything belongs to us, but such a
belief occurs only at the moments when vīthi-cittas, cittas in
processes, arise. When vīthi-cittas do not arise, we do not see, hear,
smell, taste or experience tangible object; we do not experience any
object through the six doors. At the moments when we are fast asleep,
there is no attachment, no longing or yearning, no infatuation with
anything; there is no clinging to the khandhas we are used to taking for
self. The reason is that at such moments vīthi-cittas do not arise that
know objects through the six doors. Thus, only at the moments of our
life when we are fast asleep is there no attachment or involvement with
the sense objects or with the matters we think about. Why then do we not
develop paññā so that attachment and clinging to the objects that appear
through the six doors will be eradicated and there will be less akusala?

Realities appear only at the moments vīthi-cittas,
cittas in processes, arise. When a citta arises and then falls away, it
has disappeared completely. When a rūpa arises and then falls away it
has disappeared completely. The visible object that just a moment ago
appeared through the eyes has completely fallen away, as have each of
the cittas that arose just a few moments ago in the eye-door process.
All cittas and all rūpas arise and then fall away and are gone forever.


However, so long as the arising and falling away of nāma
and rūpa has not been realized through direct understanding, through
insight, we cannot grasp what falling away means. We have not yet
realized the falling away of any reality through the development of
vipassanā. We may say that at this moment seeing-consciousness falls
away, that receiving-consciousness, investigating-consciousness,
determining-consciousness, javana-cittas and registering-consciousness
fall away, but the falling away of dhammas has not yet been penetrated
by insight. Paññā should be developed so that it can penetrate the
arising and falling away of nāma and rūpa. Even if paññā has not reached
that degree yet, it is most beneficial to listen to the Dhamma and to
consider it, so that right understanding can develop and become keener,
more refined. Right understanding can be accumulated and then it can be
a condition for satipaṭṭhāna to arise and be mindful of the
characteristics of the dhammas that arise and fall away. In that way,
paññā can gradually develop and penetrate the characteristics of dhammas
so that they will be realized as not a living being, not a person, not
self.

The “Atthasālinī” (II, Book II, Part II, Discourse on
the Chapter of the Summary, Ch I, The Triplets, 361) explains the
meaning of past dhammas: “...past means having got beyond the three
moments.” 

These three moments are the moment of arising (uppāda
khaṇa), the moment of presence (tiṭṭhi khaṇa) and the moment of falling
away (bhanga khaṇa)[^139].

Citta has only an extremely short duration: it arises,
it is present and then it falls away immediately. Its arising moment is
not the moment of its presence nor of its falling away. The moment of
its presence is not its arising moment nor the moment of its falling
away. The moment of its falling away is not its arising moment nor the
moment of its presence. When citta has arisen, it is present and the
moment of its presence cannot be called past, but its arising moment
belongs already to the past.

When we study rūpa, we learn that rūpa that is
originated by kamma (kammaja rūpa) arises at each of the three moments
of citta. Thus, it arises at the arising moment of citta, at the moment
of presence of citta and at the moment of the falling away of citta.
Rūpa produced by kamma arises at the three moments of citta throughout
our life. However, it does not arise anymore during the sixteen moments
of citta before the dying-consciousness; rūpa produced by kamma comes to
an end when the dying-consciousness falls away.[^140] That is
the end of the five khandhas that constitute the life of a particular
person.

The rūpa that originates from citta (cittaja rūpa)
arises at the arising moment of citta. The rebirth-consciousness, the
five pairs of sense-cognitions, the four arūpāvacara
vipākacittas[^141] and the dying-consciousness of the arahat do
not produce any rūpa. 

The rūpa that originates from temperature (utuja rūpa,
the Element of Heat that is of the right temperature) arises at the
moment of presence of the temperature that originates it.[^142]

The rūpa that originates from nutrition (ahāraja rūpa)
arises at the moment of presence of nutritive essence, oja rūpa, present
in food that was taken. When the nutritive essence that is in food has
been absorbed, it can produce other rūpas.

Citta arises and falls away very rapidly, and thus all
three moments of citta disappear immediately. As the “Atthasālinī”
explains, any dhamma that is past has got beyond the three moments: the
arising moment, the moment of presence and the moment of falling away;
it has gone forever, there is nothing left of it.

The “Atthasālinī”, in the same section (361), explains
synonyms of the word “past.” We read: 

> “Ceased, that is, has reached
cessation.” Past dhamma has ceased completely, just as fire that has
been extinguished. 

> “Dissolved, that is, gone to destruction, departed.”
There is nothing left, just as someone who has died, who is no more.
That is the characteristic of falling away.

> “Changed, that is, transformed by abandoning the
original nature.” Thus, so long as a dhamma has its original, usual
nature, it exists, but when it abandons its original nature, it does not
exist anymore.

> “Terminated, this means gone to the term (end) called
cessation.” It cannot exist any longer, that is the meaning of
cessation. 

> “Exterminated...” This word is stronger then the
preceding term “terminated” and the meaning is: it has disappeared
completely, there is nothing left of it.

> “Dissolved after having arisen, that is, departed after
having come to be.” This does not mean that the dhamma did not exist. It
was, because it had arisen, but after its arising it departed, it
disappeared completely, and there is nothing left of it. 

We then read: “Which are past dhammas? Rūpa, feeling,
perception, formations, consciousness.” These are the five khandhas,
which are conditioned dhammas, saṅkhata dhammas. The five khandhas
comprise the following realities:

- Rūpakkhandha: all rūpas that arise and fall away. 
- Vedanākkhandha: all feelings (vedanā cetasika), which arise and
 fall away. 
- Saññākkhandha: remembrance or perception (saññā cetasika), which
 arises and falls away. 
- Saṅkhārakkhandha: fifty cetasikas (formations) such as attachment,
 aversion, jealousy, avarice, confidence, energy and wisdom; they
 arise and then fall away. 
- Viññāṇakkhandha: each type of citta that arises and falls away. 



Everything that arises is conditioned dhamma; it is one
of the five khandhas and thus it falls away again. For which of the
khandhas are we then still longing, to which of them do we still cling?
Each khandha arises and then falls away; it dissolves, disappears
completely, there is nothing left of it, there is nothing worth clinging
to.

Through knowledge acquired from reading and listening
defilements cannot be eradicated, they are still bound to be present in
full force. When we consider dhammas and have right understanding of
them, conditions are being accumulated for the arising of right
awareness. Then sati can be directly aware and attend to the
characteristics of the dhammas of which we formerly had theoretical
understanding acquired through listening. In this way paññā can
penetrate the characteristics of realities that appear and then fall
away, and wrong view, which takes realities for a living being, a person
or self, can be eliminated.

We are so used to being attached to what appears through
the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the bodysense and the
mind-door. We take it for self, for mine, for my property. In reality
everything that appears does so only at the moment when citta in a
process, vīthi-citta, arises. The dhammas that are vipāka are the
results of kamma. We may have a house, many possessions, clothes and
ornaments that are all very beautiful and attractive, but in reality
there are only vipākacittas, results of past kammas, that arise and
experience objects through the eyes, the ears and the other sense-doors.
Citta arises and experiences an object just for one moment and then it
falls away; it is gone forever, it cannot last at all. Nobody knows
which kamma will produce which result in the future. The reason is that
we all have performed both kusala kamma and akusala kamma in the past.
When there are the right conditions for kamma to produce result,
vipākacitta arises and experiences an object through one of the six
doors.

When we learn about the truth of impermanence and ponder
over it, we can be urged to persevere with awareness of the
characteristics of dhammas that appear. If sati can be aware of the
characteristics of dhammas and paññā investigates them, over and over
again, they can be realized as they are: as not self, as only nāma and
rūpa appearing one at a time through the six doors.

Through right understanding of the characteristics of
dhammas there will be conditions for kusala javana vīthi-cittas. If we
do not listen to the Dhamma and do not investigate realities, we shall
not know when there is vipāka, the result of past kamma, and when there
are kusala javana vīthi-cittas or akusala javana vīthi-cittas that arise
in their own series. If we do not know this, we shall not see the danger
and disadvantage of akusala and we shall not be inclined to develop
kusala. Then the cycle of birth and death will go on endlessly. Are
there more kusala cittas or more akusala cittas during the day? In the
future the appropriate result of kamma will arise, be it kusala vipāka
or akusala vipāka. It is beneficial to consider and to be aware of the
realities that naturally appear in our daily life. 



### Specifications of Cittas and their Functions



There are fourteen different functions of citta in all:

1. The function of rebirth, paṭisandhi, which follows upon the
 function of dying, cuti, of the previous life. The cittas that
 perform the function of rebirth are nineteen types[^143] of
 vipākacittas:
    - kāmāvacara vipākacittas (results of the sense sphere)     10
 cittas 
    - rūpāvacara vipākacittas (results of rūpa jhāna) 
   5 cittas 
    - arūpāvacara vipākacittas (results of arūpa jhāna)[^144] 
   4 cittas 
   
2. The function of life-continuum, bhavanga, the preservation of
 continuity in a lifespan. The cittas that perform the function of
 bhavanga are also nineteen types of vipākacittas. Whatever type of
 citta performs the function of rebirth in a lifespan also performs
 the function of bhavanga, after the rebirth-consciousness has fallen
 away. The bhavanga-cittas that arise during one lifespan are all of
 the same type as the rebirth-consciousness. They arise and fall away
 in succession until vīthi-citta arises and experiences an object
 through one of the six doors, and when the vīthi-cittas of that
 process have fallen away, bhavanga-cittas of the same type as the
 rebirth-consciousness follow again. This happens all the time until
 the dying-consciousness arises at the end of our lifespan. 

3. The function of adverting, āvajjana, the adverting to an object
 that impinges on one of the six doorways. Adverting-consciousness is
 the first vīthi-citta that arises in a process and experiences an
 object through one of the six doorways. There are two types of
 kiriyacitta that perform the function of adverting: 
    - the five-sense-door adverting-consciousness,
 pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta; 
    - the mind-door adverting-consciousness, mano-dvārāvajjana-citta. 

4. The function of seeing, dassana kicca. There are two types of
 vipākacitta that perform the function of seeing: 
    - seeing-consciousness that is akusala vipākacitta; 
    - seeing-consciousness that is kusala vipākacitta. 

5. The function of hearing, savana kicca. There are two types of
 vipākacitta that perform the function of hearing: 
    - hearing-consciousness that is akusala vipākacitta; 
    - hearing-consciousness that is kusala vipākacitta. 

6. The function of smelling, ghāyana kicca. There are twotypes of
 vipākacitta that perform the function of smelling: 
    - smelling-consciousness that is akusala vipākacitta; 
    - smelling-consciousness that is kusala vipākacitta. 

7. The function of tasting, sāyana kicca. There are two types of
 vipākacitta that perform the function of tasting: 
    - tasting-consciousness that is akusala vipākacitta; 
    - tasting-consciousness that is kusala vipākacitta. 

8. The function of experiencing tangible object through the
 bodysense, phusana kicca. There are two types of vipākacitta that
 perform this function: 
    - body-consciousness that is akusala vipākacitta; 
    - body-consciousness that is kusala vipākacitta. 

9. The function of receiving, sampaṭicchana kicca, which is the
 receiving of the object after one of the sense-cognitions has fallen
 away. There are two types of citta that perform this function: 
    - receiving-consciousness that is akusala vipākacitta; 
    - receiving-consciousness that is kusala vipākacitta. 

10. The function of investigation, santīraṇa kicca, which is the
 investigation of the object that appears through one of the five
 sense-doors. There are three types of citta that perform this
 function: 
    - investigation-consciousness accompanied by indifferent feeling
 (upekkhā) that is akusala vipākacitta; 
    - investigation-consciousness accompanied by indifferent feeling
 that is kusala vipākacitta; 
    - investigation-consciousness accompanied by pleasant feeling
 (somanassa) that is kusala vipākacitta. 

11. The function of determination, votthapana kicca, which is the
 determination of the object so that such or such types of
 javana-cittas follow in one of the five sense-door processes. There
 is one type of kiriyacitta that performs this function: the
 mind-door adverting-consciousness, mano-dvārāvajjana-citta. 

12. The function of javana, javana kicca, which is “running through
 the object” or partaking of the object. There are fifty-five types
 of citta that can perform the function of javana: 
    - akusala cittas 
   12 cittas[^145] 
    - ahetuka kiriyacitta (hasituppada citta of the
 arahat)[^146]    1 citta
    - kāmāvacara kusala cittas (of the sense sphere[^147])  
  8 cittas
    - kāmāvacara kiriyacittas (of the arahat)     
       8 cittas 
    - rūpāvacara kusala cittas (of rūpa-jhāna)    
    5 cittas 
    - rūpāvacara kiriyacittas (of the arahat)     
       5 cittas 
    - arūpāvacara kusala cittas (of arūpa-jhāna)   
     4 cittas 
    - arūpāvacara kiriyacittas (of the arahat)    
        4 cittas 
    - lokuttara cittas (experiencing nibbāna)     
       8 cittas 

13. The function of registering or retention, tadālambana kicca,
 which is the function of knowing the object after the javana-cittas
 have fallen away. There are eleven types of vipākacittas that can
 perform this function: 
    - investigation-consciousness, santīraṇa-citta  
      3 cittas 
    - kāmāvacara sahetuka kusala vipākacitta 
    (accompanied by roots)    
   8 cittas

14. The function of dying, cuti kicca, the function of departure from
 this lifespan. After the cuti-citta has arisen, performed this
 function and fallen away, it is the end of this lifespan and one is
 no longer this particular individual. There are nineteen types of
 vipākacittas that can perform the function of dying, and they are of
 the same types as those that perform the function of rebirth and the
 function of bhavanga. Whatever type performs the function of rebirth
 in a lifespan also performs the function of bhavanga and the
 function of dying, in the same lifespan. 



It is because of conditions that the
rebirth-consciousness arises in a particular lifespan with different
accompanying cetasikas and together with rūpas of different quality,
depending on the strength and the nature of that type of rebirth-consciousness.

There are ten types of kāmāvacara vipākacittas that can
perform the function of rebirth in eleven planes of existence of the
sense sphere (kāma bhūmi):

- investigating-consciousness 

accompanied by indifferent feeling that is akusala vipāka 
1 citta

- investigating-consciousness

accompanied by indifferent feeling that is kusala vipāka 
1 citta

- kāmāvacara sahetuka kusala vipākacittas (mahā-vipāka) 
  8 cittas 



Investigating-consciousness accompanied by indifferent
feeling, that is akusala vipāka, is the result of akusala kamma and it
can perform the function of rebirth in four classes of unhappy planes of
existence: the hell planes, the ghost-realm (of petas), the demon-world
(asura-kāya) and the animal world.[^148]

Investigating-consciousness accompanied by indifferent
feeling that is kusala vipāka, is the result of kusala kamma that is
weak, and it can perform the function of rebirth in the human plane. In
that case, akusala kamma has the opportunity to make that person suffer,
and cause him to be handicapped from the time of his conception. He will
be born mentally handicapped, mute, blind, cripple or with other kinds
of weaknesses. It can also perform the function of rebirth in the lowest
heavenly plane, the plane of the “Four Guardian Deities”
(Cātummahārājika).

The eight types of mahā-vipākacittas can perform the
function of rebirth in the human plane and in six classes of heavenly
planes, and their different qualities depend on the strength and the
degree of excellence of the kusala kammas that condition
them.[^149]

The five types of rūpāvacara vipākacittas perform the
function of rebirth in fifteen rūpa-brahma planes, and the different
degrees of these kinds of rebirth depend on the rūpāvacara kusala citta
that is the cause of them.

The four types of arūpāvacara vipākacittas perform the
function of rebirth in four arūpa-brahma planes, and the different
degrees of these kinds of rebirth depend on the arūpāvacara kusala citta
that is the cause of them.

The eleven kinds of tadālambana-cittas, which perform
the function of retention or registering and which follow upon the
javana-cittas, do not arise in the rūpa-brahma planes and the
arūpa-brahma planes.[^150]

There are two types of cittas performing five functions,
which are the function of rebirth, bhavanga, santīraṇa, tadālambana and
dying, namely: investigating-consciousness accompanied by indifferent
feeling that is akusala vipāka and investigating-consciousness
accompanied by indifferent feeling that is kusala vipāka.

The eight types of mahā-vipākacittas perform four
functions, which are the function of rebirth, bhavanga, tadālambana and
dying.

The five types of rūpāvacara vipākacittas perform three
functions and the four types of arūpāvacara vipākacittas also perform
three functions, which are the function of rebirth, of bhavanga and of
dying. 

There are two types of citta that can perform two
functions, namely the mind-door adverting-consciousness[^151]
and the investigating-consciousness accompanied by pleasant
feeling.[^152]

All the other types of cittas perform only one function,
their own proper function.
