# The Cycle of Birth and Death





As we have seen, the first aspect of citta given by the
“Atthasālinī” is clear knowledge of an object. Remembrance of this
aspect can be a supporting condition for sati to arise and to be aware
of the characteristic of citta when there is seeing, hearing, smelling,
tasting or the experience of tangible object. Such experiences can then
be realized as citta, not self, who experiences. Citta is the reality,
the dhamma, which clearly knows the object that is appearing.

The second aspect of citta is the aspect of
javana-citta, which arranges itself in its own series of cittas of the
same type. People have diverse inclinations because of different
accumulations of kusala and akusala. Some people have accumulated a
great deal of attachment, aversion and ignorance, whereas others have
accumulated many wholesome qualities. Because of different accumulated
inclinations people have different characters. 

The third aspect of citta is the aspect of vipāka, of
citta as result, conditioned by accumulated kamma and
defilements.[^153] If one has right understanding of
vīthi-citta, citta arising in a process, it will be clearer what the
cycle of birth and death is. We are born and we revolve in a threefold
cycle: the cycle of defilement, the cycle of kamma and the cycle of
vipāka. This threefold cycle is summarized in the third aspect of citta,
citta as vipāka, conditioned by accumulated kamma and defilements. 

Kusala dhammas and akusala dhammas that arise at the
moment of javana-citta fall away again, but they are not lost, they are
accumulated and go on from one moment of citta to the next moment of
citta. Citta that arises falls away again, but its falling away is a
condition for the arising of the succeeding citta and all accumulations
present in the preceding citta go on to the succeeding citta. That is
the reason why akusala javana vīthi-citta and kusala javana vīthi-citta,
which arrange themselves in their own continuing series, can condition
the arising of vipāka later on. 

As we have seen, the cycle of birth and death is
threefold: the cycle of defilement, the cycle of kamma and the cycle of
vipāka. The cycle of defilement revolves when objects are experienced
through the sense-doors and through the mind-door. Defilements that
arise in the series, or succession of javana, are the condition for the
cycle of kamma. Akusala kamma and kusala kamma, performed through body,
speech and mind are the condition for the cycle of vipāka. 

When vipākacitta arises and experiences an object
through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue or the bodysense,
defilements are bound to arise on account of the object that is
experienced, and then the cycle of defilement revolves again. Time and
again the defilements of like or dislike arise because of what appears
through the sense-doors or the mind-door. Defilements again condition
the performing of kamma, kusala kamma and akusala kamma, and these
produce kusala vipāka and akusala vipāka. Thus, there is no end to the
threefold cycle. So long as paññā has not been developed and is not
powerful enough to reach the stage of being able to realize the four
noble Truths, the threefold cycle of defilement, kamma and vipāka is
bound to revolve all the time.

The “Dependent Origination,” Paticca Samuppāda, which is
the teaching of the arising of phenomena in dependence upon each other,
can be considered under the aspect of the threefold cycle. Ignorance,
avijjā, is the condition for the arising of kamma-formation, saṅkhāra.
This means that the cycle of defilement conditions the cycle of kamma.
Kamma-formation, saṅkhāra, is the condition for the arising of
consciousness, viññāṇa (in this case vipākacitta); this means that the
cycle of kamma conditions the cycle of vipāka.[^154]

Ignorance, avijjā, is actually moha cetasika, the
akusala dhamma that does not know realities as they are. It represents
the cycle of defilement that conditions the arising of kamma-formations.


Kamma-formation, saṅkhāra, which is the fruit of
ignorance, is threefold:

- meritorious kamma-formation (puññābhisaṅkhāra)[^155]; 
- demeritorious kamma-formation (apuññābhisaṅkhāra)[^156]; 
- imperturbable kamma-formation (āneñjābhisaṅkhāra).



Meritorious kamma-formation is volition, cetanā,
performing kusala kamma that is dependent on rūpa, materiality, and this
includes kāmāvacara kusala kamma (of the sense sphere) and rūpāvacara
kusala kamma (rūpa-jhāna, of the fine-material sphere).

Demeritorious kamma-formation is the volition that
performs akusala kamma. 

Imperturbable kamma-formation is arūpāvacara kusala
kamma, volition arising with the four types of arūpa-jhāna kusala citta
(immaterial jhāna). 

Meritorious kamma-formation, demeritorious
kamma-formation and imperturbable kamma-formation are conditions for the
arising of viññāṇa. Viññāṇa is a synonym of citta, consciousness, but in
the context of the “Dependent Origination” it is vipākacitta. The
vipākacitta that is rebirth-consciousness arises in different planes of
existence, in accordance with the cause, kamma, that produces it.

The Buddha explained the Dhamma by different methods,
for example, by way of the four paramattha dhammas, by way of the four
noble Truths or by way of the “Dependent Origination.” These different
methods concern the dhammas that occur at each moment, even now, at this
very moment.

The third aspect of citta is citta as vipāka. Vipāka is
conditioned by accumulated kamma and defilements. This shows us that in
daily life there are defilements, kamma or vipāka at different moments.
Right understanding of vīthi-citta is a condition for mindfulness and
investigation of different cittas arising in processes that experience
visible object, sound, the other sense objects or mental object. Then
paññā can come to know when there is defilement, when kamma and when
vipāka. 

For example, with regard to cittas arising in the
eye-door process, some cittas are vipāka and some are not:

- the five sense-door adverting-consciousness is not vipākacitta; 
- seeing-consciousness is vipākacitta;
- receiving-consciousness is vipākacitta; 
- investigating-consciousness is vipākacitta;
- determining-consciousness is not vipākacitta;
- javana-cittas that are kusala, akusala or kiriya are not
 vipākacitta;
- registering-consciousness is vipākacitta. 

We may wonder of what use it is to know in detail at
which moment there is vipāka and at which moment there is not vipāka in
the eye-door process. It is useful to know that the dhammas that are
cause are different from the dhammas that are result. Akusala dhammas
and kusala dhammas are cause, not vipāka. When there is vipākacitta,
there is result originating from a cause; vipāka itself is not a cause.
If we understand at which moment there is vipāka, result produced by
past kamma, such as seeing now, can we still believe that there is a
self who can cause the arising of particular vipākas? If we have right
understanding of the citta that is cause and of the citta that is
result, we shall know the meaning of anattā, non-self. We shall
understand anattā when seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, experiencing
tangible object or thinking. This understanding can be a supporting
condition for sati to be aware of the realities that appear at such
moments and, thus, there will be more understanding of the different
characteristics of these realities that arise, each because of its own
conditions. 

Some people fear that vipāka will not arise anymore,
they are afraid that vipāka will come to an end at death. There is no
reason to be afraid of this, we do not have to worry that vipāka will
not arise anymore today, tomorrow, the next days, the coming months,
years or lives. When someone is not yet an arahat, there are still
conditions present for the continuation of vipāka; it will arise time
and again. We should consider what kind of kamma is going to produce
vipāka in the future. We can verify in this life, in the case of
different individuals, to what extent there is vipāka produced by kusala
kamma and to what extent vipāka produced by akusala kamma. 

In the commentary to the “Gradual Sayings,” the
“Manoratha Pūraṇi”, in the commentary to the Nidāna Sutta (Book of the
Threes, Ch IV, §33, Causes), there is an explanation of this sutta
according to the Abhidhamma method.[^157] Kamma is classified as
sixteen kinds: eight kinds of akusala kamma and eight kinds of kusala
kamma. Akusala kamma as well as kusala kamma need other conditions to be
able to produce their results. Four of these conditioning factors are
favourable or advantageous (sampatti) and four are unfavourable or
disadvantageous (vipatti). Some akusala kammas that have been performed
can be prevented from producing result through four favourable factors:
favourable place of birth (gati), favourable bodily condition (upadhi),
favourable time (kāla) and success in means or occupation
(payoga).[^158] Thus, when someone has a favourable place of
birth, has a favourable bodily condition, lives in a favourable time and
has success in his means or occupation, some akusala kammas do not have
an opportunity to produce results.

Some akusala kammas have the opportunity to produce
result because of four unfavourable factors: unfavourable place of
birth, unfavourable bodily condition, unfavourable time and failure in
one’s means or occupation.

It is the same in the case of kusala kamma. If someone
has the factors of unfavourable place of birth, unfavourable bodily
condition, unfavourable time and failure in occupation, some kusala
kammas do not have an opportunity to produce result.

Some kusala kammas have the opportunity to produce
result because of four favourable factors: favourable place of birth,
favourable bodily condition, favourable time and success in occupation.
Thus, when we take into account the four favourable factors and the four
unfavourable factors in the case of kusala kamma and of akusala kamma,
kamma can be classified as sixteen-fold. 

Favourable place of birth (gati sampatti) is a happy
plane of existence where one is born. Unfavourable place of birth (gati
vipatti) is an unhappy plane of existence where one is born, such as a
hell plane.

We all have to be reborn as soon as the
dying-consciousness falls away, but nobody knows whether the place one
will go to will be happy or unhappy. Some people wish to be reborn into
a family where there is no addiction to alcohol or intoxicating drugs,
but so long as the moment of dying has not come yet, one does not know
what types of javana vīthi-cittas that condition rebirth will arise
before the dying-consciousness. One does not know which kamma will
produce vipāka after the dying-consciousness, in the form of rebirth and
in which plane there will be rebirth.

When kusala kamma produces result in the form of rebirth
in a happy plane, there is a favourable place of rebirth. There is not
only the kusala kamma that produces rebirth in a happy plane, but there
are also other kusala kammas performed in the cycle of birth and death.
On account of a happy rebirth these kammas can have an opportunity to
produce, in the course of life, kusala vipākacittas that experience
pleasant objects. However, one also committed akusala kamma in the past
and thus one cannot experience only pleasant objects. When akusala kamma
produces result, there is the experience of unpleasant objects through
the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue or the bodysense. We all have
performed both kusala kamma and akusala kamma but the opportunity for
them to produce result depends on the factors of favourable or
unfavourable place of birth and on other conditions.

Bodily condition (upadhi)[^159] is another
factor that can be favourable or unfavourable. Dukkha, suffering, is
inherent in bodily condition. Even when someone is born as a human
being, thus, in a happy plane, akusala kamma that was committed in the
past can be the condition for having a body with defects or handicaps. A
defective body is an unfavourable bodily condition that contributes to
akusala kamma producing results more often than kusala kamma. 

Apart from this factor there is the time factor, which
can be favourable (kāla sampatti) or unfavourable (kāla vipatti). The
factor of time that is favourable conditions kusala kamma that has been
performed in the past to produce result. When one lives in a favourable
time, there is an abundance of food, enough fish in the water and plenty
of rice in the fields. Then it is not difficult to obtain food and food
is not expensive. When the country where one lives is prosperous and
there is peace, when one can live in comfort, with an abundance of all
the things one needs, kusala kamma has the opportunity to condition the
arising of kusala vipākacitta. Then vipākacitta experiences pleasant
objects through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue and the
bodysense.

It may happen that one lives in an unfavourable time,
when the country is in a state of unrest, when food is hard to obtain
and expensive. Then kusala kamma does not have an opportunity, to the
same extent as when the time is favourable, to condition the arising of
kusala vipākacitta that experiences pleasant objects through the senses.
Even upright people who do not cause trouble to anybody may still have
unpleasant experiences, they may suffer from pain or sickness or they
may lose their lives, because they live in an unfavourable time. One may
have accumulated kusala kamma, but if one lives in an unfavourable time,
when one’s country is in disorder and confusion, akusala kamma committed
in the past has the opportunity to produce result in the form of akusala
vipākacitta, and this can happen also at this time. 

Success or failure in one’s means or occupation (payoga
sampatti and vipatti) are also factors that condition kamma to produce
result or that can prevent kamma from producing result. Someone is
successful in his occupation when he is skilful, diligent and clever in
the performing of his tasks. Each kind of occupation, even that of a
thief, needs expertise and skill for the accomplishment of one’s tasks.
The ability to accomplish one’s work is success in occupation, be it in
a wholesome way or in an unwholesome way. No matter which profession or
task one performs, one needs success in occupation, skilfulness and
competence in the accomplishment of one’s work. Then akusala kamma that
has been committed in the past has no opportunity to condition
vipākacitta. Someone may be upright, but he may lack expertise,
knowledge and competence in his profession or task, and thus there is
failure in occupation. This may prevent the arising of kusala vipāka. 

The Buddha taught in detail about the causes that bring
their appropriate results and he also explained about the different
conditioning factors necessary for the arising of results. His teaching
about this subject illustrates the truth of anattā. There is no self who
can cause anything to arise at will. Each citta that arises is dependent
on different conditions. As we have seen, the producing of result by
kusala kamma or akusala kamma is also dependent on other conditioning
factors, which are: favourable or unfavourable place of birth,
favourable or unfavourable bodily condition, favourable or unfavourable
time and success or failure in one’s occupation.

Right understanding of cause and result, that is, of
defilements, of kamma and of vipāka, can be a condition for a decrease
in the suffering, dukkha, which is inherent in the cycle of birth and
death. We should know with regard to the vīthi-cittas, for example,
those of the eye-door process, what is vipāka and what is kamma, and we
should know that vipākacittas cannot perform kamma. The vipākacittas in
that process are, as explained before, seeing-consciousness,
receiving-consciousness that receives the object after the
seeing-consciousness, and investigating-consciousness that investigates
the object after the receiving-consciousness. When one performs kusala
kamma there are no vipākacittas but kusala javana-cittas. 

When one hears a pleasant sound, the vipākacitta that is
hearing-consciousness arises and just hears, the receiving-consciousness
receives that sound, the investigating-consciousness investigates it,
examines it. These vipākacittas cannot perform any akusala kamma or
kusala kamma. 

When one smells a fragrant odour that impinges on the
nose, the vipākacitta that is smelling-consciousness arises and
experiences that odour. The receiving-consciousness receives that smell
and the investigating-consciousness examines it. These vipākacittas
cannot perform kamma; they cannot cause the movement of any rūpa of the
body to perform kamma. 

When we speak, walk, lift our hands, or when the body
moves for the performing of different functions, the citta at such
moments is different from the vipākacitta that sees, hears, tastes,
smells or experiences tangible object. The javana vīthi-cittas, be they
kusala or akusala, can cause the movement of rūpas of the body. Thus, we
can understand that the cittas that perform kamma are altogether
different from vipākacittas.

While we are eating different types of citta arise. The
citta that sees is vipākacitta, the citta that likes the food that is
seen is akusala citta rooted in attachment, the citta that dislikes the
food that is seen is akusala citta rooted in

aversion. The citta that tastes a sour or sweet flavour is vipākacitta.
The citta that, with desire, conditions the movement of the body when
taking the food, when chewing and swallowing it, is akusala citta rooted
in attachment. Sati can arise and be aware of the characteristics of the
different kinds of cittas as they naturally appear, so that they can be
known as they are. One should not try to flee from lobha, but one should
know it as it is; and only thus can it be eventually eradicated.

Since the time of our birth there were conditions for
the arising of attachment, time and again, in daily life, and therefore
attachment has become our nature. While we are doing our work there is,
most of the time, attachment; thus, the moments of attachment that arise
in a day are countless. However, if we see the benefit of kusala, there
can also be conditions for the arising of kusala citta. While we are
eating, javana vīthi-cittas with attachment are likely to arise and fall
away, but the javana-cittas in the next process may be different. If
sati can be mindful of the citta that enjoys the food, there are kusala
javana-cittas. Or sati can be mindful of the characteristics of rūpas,
such as softness, hardness, cold, heat, motion, pressure, or of the
flavour that appears, which may be sour, sweet or salty. 

When one develops satipaṭṭhāna, right understanding can
come to know the nature of citta. Akusala can be known as it is, before
there is any action through body or speech. Sati can be aware of the
citta that sees and then there can be right understanding of its
characteristic, as being different from the citta with attachment to the
object that appears. 

As we have seen, the third aspect of citta is the aspect
of citta as vipāka, conditioned by accumulated kamma and defilements.
Defilement is the dhamma that is impure. When one desires something or
wishes to obtain something for oneself, there is no contentment, no
peace. Whereas, if one does not want anything for oneself and attachment
does not arise, there is contentment. When one longs for something, when
one is attached, there is ignorance which is unable to see that at such
moments there are impure dhammas, that there is no inward peace but
confusion caused by clinging. Whenever one is disturbed by selfish
desire, by clinging, there are impure, akusala dhammas. People sometimes
mistake attachment for confidence in kusala (saddhā).[^160] If
sati does not arise and paññā does not investigate realities, it will
not be known when there is attachment that is akusala and when there is
confidence in wholesomeness that is kusala.

Monks and laypeople, who still have defilements, are not
free from attachment; it arises in daily life. So long as defilements
have not been eradicated, be it in the case of layman or monk,
attachment to what appears through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the
tongue, the bodysense or the mind-door will arise. The different
defilements that arise time and again can be very strong, and then they
are of the degree of akusala kamma committed through the body or through
speech. If defilements would be eradicated, akusala kamma could not
arise. When one has performed kamma, the citta and cetasikas that arose
together at that moment have fallen away, but kamma is never lost. It is
accumulated and goes on from one citta to the next citta, since each
citta that falls away is succeeded by the next citta, all the time.
Because of this, there can be kamma-condition (kamma-paccaya), that is,
kamma that conditions the arising of result, vipākacitta and its
accompanying cetasikas. 

We should know when there are defilements, when kamma
and when vipāka. The cittas that see, hear, smell, taste or experience
tangible object are vipākacittas, results of kamma. We all like to see
only pleasant things and we never have enough of seeing them. We have
eyesense, a rūpa that is conditioned by kamma, thus we have the ability
to see, but we cannot be sure whether we shall see a pleasant object or
an unpleasant object. It depends on kamma-condition whether a pleasant
object or an unpleasant object will impinge on the eyesense and appear
to seeing-consciousness. When kusala kamma is kamma-condition, it causes
seeing-consciousness that is kusala vipākacitta to arise and to
experience a pleasant object. When akusala kamma is kamma-condition, it
causes seeing-consciousness that is akusala vipākacitta to arise and to
experience an unpleasant object. When hearing-consciousness hears a
pleasant sound, it is the result of kusala kamma. When
hearing-consciousness hears an unpleasant sound, it is the result of
akusala kamma. The arising of kusala vipāka or akusala vipāka at this
moment or the next moments depends on kusala kamma or akusala kamma that
is the condition for the vipākacitta that experiences an object through
one of the senses. 

There are twenty-four principal conditions for all
realities that arise.[^161] Kamma-condition, kamma-paccaya, is
one condition among them, being the condition for the arising of vipāka.
Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or the experience of tangible
object, are vipākacittas accompanied by vipākacetasikas that arise
because of kamma-condition. Nobody can cause the arising of vipāka
according to his wish. At this moment, we have seen already, we have
heard already. Who can prevent seeing or hearing when they have already
arisen because of kamma-condition?

Citta and cetasikas that experience an object appearing
through the senses are vipākacitta and vipākacetasikas that arise
together. Vipākacitta is a condition for vipākacetasika and
vipākacetasika is a condition for vipākacitta, and, thus, since they are
both vipāka they condition one another by way of vipāka-condition,
vipāka-paccaya. The citta and cetasikas that arise together and are
vipāka, condition one another; each of them, citta and each of the
accompanying cetasikas, is vipāka-condition for the other conascent
dhammas. 

The rūpa that is conditioned by kamma is not vipāka,
although it is the result of kamma. Rūpa is altogether different from
nāma, it does not know anything and thus it is not vipāka that is the
mental result of kamma. Vipāka is nāma, the reality that experiences an
object.
