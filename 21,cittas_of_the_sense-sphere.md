# Cittas of the Sense-Sphere

There are eighty-nine different types of citta and these
can be classified according to different grades, namely as four planes
(bhūmi) of citta:

- sensuous plane, kāmāvacara bhūmi, 
- fine-material plane, rūpāvacara bhūmi (rūpa-jhāna), 
- immaterial plane, arūpāvacara bhūmi (arūpa-jhāna), 
- supramundane plane, lokuttara bhūmi. 



The “Atthasālinī” (I, Book I, Part II, Analysis of
terms, 62) gives an explanation of the meaning of kāmāvacara, sensuous,
according to different methods. According to one method of explanation,
kāmāvacara is used for the citta that is involved in kāmāvacara dhammas,
thus, it is the citta which is of the grade of the sensuous plane of
consciousness. “Kāmāvacara” is the complete term,[^169] but the
abridged form of “kāma” is also used. Citta of the grade or plane of
kāma, kāmāvacara citta, frequents objects of sense, namely: visible
object, sound, odour, flavour and tangible object.

At each moment in daily life there is kāmāvacara citta,
except when there is citta of another grade or plane that is more
refined than that of the kāmāvacara citta. When one develops kusala
citta with calm by means of a meditation subject that is dependent on
rūpa, materiality, and calm becomes firmly established so that it
reaches the level of attainment concentration (appanā samādhi), there is
rūpa-jhānacitta, which has an object that is still dependent on rūpa.
Then there is a higher plane of citta, the fine material plane of citta,
rūpāvacara bhūmi, and the citta of this plane, the rūpāvacara citta, is
free from kāma, sensuousness. A plane of citta that is still higher is
the arūpa bhūmi, immaterial plane. The citta of this plane, the
arūpāvacara citta, is of a higher degree of calm and more refined,
firmly established in calm with an object that is not dependent on rūpa.
The citta that is even more refined than arūpāvacara citta is lokuttara
citta which realizes the characteristic of nibbāna. That is the citta of
the supramundane plane, lokuttara bhūmi. Thus, cittas are varied as they
are of different planes of citta. The eighty-nine cittas can be
classified according to the planes of citta in the following way:

- 54 kāmāvacara cittas,[^170] 
- 15 rūpāvacara cittas,[^171] 
- 12 arūpāvacara cittas,[^172] 
- 8 lokuttara cittas.[^173] 



There is kāmāvacara citta at the moments when there is
not rūpāvacara citta, arūpāvacara citta or lokuttara citta. 

The “Atthasālinī” (in the same section) states that the
term kāma, sensuousness, has two meanings:

- sensuousness of defilements, kilesa kāma, 
- the base or foundation of sensuousness, vatthu kāma. 

The “Atthasālinī” states:

> “The sensuousness of the defilements is so termed because it desires,
and the other, the sensuousness of base, is so termed because it is
desired by the sensuousness of defilements.”

Kilesa kāma is sense desire (chanda rāga) that is lobha
cetasika, the dhamma that enjoys objects, is pleased with them and
clings to them. Vatthu kāma are the objects that are the basis on which
desire or clinging depends, that which is desired. Vatthu kāma also
comprises the three classes of planes of existence where a person can be
reborn: the sensuous planes of existence (kāma bhūmi), the fine material
planes (rūpa bhūmi)[^174] and the immaterial
planes.[^175] So long as lobha has not been eradicated, one is
not free from the cycle of birth and death and, thus, one can be reborn
in those planes. They are vatthu kāma, the objects for kilesa kāma, the
sensuousness of defilements. 

Kāmāvacara citta that is attached to visible object,
sound, odour, flavour and tangible object clings firmly to them, even
though they appear just for a moment. Visible object appears for an
extremely short moment, when it impinges on the eyesense. Sound appears
just for an extremely short moment, when it impinges on the earsense. It
is the same with odour, flavour and tangible object. All of them are
insignificant dhammas (paritta dhammas), they appear just for a moment
and then they fall away. Nevertheless, citta is attached and clings all
the time to these insignificant dhammas. Since these dhammas that arise
and fall away are succeeding one another, it seems that they can last,
that they do not fall away.

There is no end to clinging to all the sense objects, to
visible object, sound, odour, flavour and tangible object. We are
infatuated with them and keep on clinging to them. These objects fall
away, but they are replaced; the rūpas that fall away are succeeded by
new ones. We are deluded and cling again to visible object, sound and
the other sense objects that replace those which have fallen away and
thus clinging continues all the time. When we see visible object and we
like it, we want to see it again and again. When we hear a sound that we
like we want to hear it again, and it is the same with odour, flavour
and tangible object that we like. When we are eating and we like a
particular flavour, we wish to eat the same food again and taste that
flavour again. Clinging to the sense objects arises each day, time and
again. It is our nature to cling through the eyes, the ears, the nose,
the tongue, the bodysense and the mind-door. 

When we like something we see, we wish to see it all the
time, but that is impossible. All conditioned dhammas, saṅkhāra dhammas,
arise and then fall away; that is their nature. When a delicious flavour
appears, attachment depending on the tongue arises. At that moment
attachment through the eyes, the ears, the nose or the bodysense cannot
arise. When odour appears and attachment to it arises, there cannot be
attachment through the eyes, the ears, the tongue or the bodysense,
since only one citta arises at a time. There cannot be the arising of
two cittas at the same time. We all are attached to the objects that
appear alternately through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the
bodysense and the mind-door. We are not attached just to colour, just to
sound or just to one of the other sense objects; we are attached to all
of them. The reason is that attachment to all the sense objects has been
accumulated continuously, from the past to the present time, and it will
be accumulated on to the future.

Thus, kāmāvacara citta, citta of the sense sphere
“travels” to, frequents visible object, sound, odour, flavour and
tangible object; it clings to these objects, it is not free from them.
Some people who want to be free from sense objects say that, as a result
of having performed meritorious deeds, they want to be reborn in heaven.
Even heavenly planes are not free from sense objects, but they are more
refined than the objects in the human world.

From birth to death, when citta has not attained calm to
the degree of attainment concentration (appanā samādhi), that is, when
citta is not jhānacitta, and when citta is not lokuttara citta, citta is
kāmāvacara citta. Whether we are asleep or awake, whether we see, hear,
smell, taste, experience tangible object or think of different subjects,
at all such moments there is no living being who experiences objects,
there is no person, no self. There are only cittas of the grade of kāma,
sensuousness, kāmāvacara cittas that experience objects. 

The person who is not an anāgāmī (non-returner who has
attained the third stage of enlightenment) or an arahat still clings to
visible object, sound, odour, flavour and tangible object. This shows
how difficult it is to eradicate clinging to the sense objects that
appear through the six doors. Even if someone has cultivated calm to the
degree of jhāna and he is reborn in a brahma plane,[^176]
clinging to the sense objects cannot be completely eradicated. If he is
not yet an anāgāmī, he will again and again return to a life of clinging
to visible object and the other sense objects that appear through six
doors. Therefore, we should not be negligent with regard to the
defilements. We should understand realities as they are; we should
understand which cause brings which effect. Then we shall be able to
develop right understanding of the eightfold Path, which can eradicate
defilements completely.

Kāmāvacara is a name for the citta that is involved in
dhammas of the sense sphere, kāmāvacara dhammas. The “Atthasālinī”
explains that the planes of existence of the kāmāvacara dhammas, that
is, the sensuous planes of existence, extend from the lowest plane,
which is the “Avīci hell,” up to the highest sensuous plane which is a
heavenly plane, called the “paranimmita vasavatti deva plane” (the plane
of heavenly beings with power over the creations of others). In all
these planes there are sense objects.

As regards the term basis of sensuousness or clinging,
vatthu kama, this has, according to the “Atthasālinī, a wider meaning
than visible object, sound, odour, flavour or tangible object. Any kind
of dhamma that is a basis or foundation for attachment is actually
vatthu kāma. Lobha cetasika is the reality that is attached, which
clings to everything, except lokuttara dhammas.[^177] Lobha
clings to the rūpa-brahma planes and the arūpa -brahma planes, thus,
these are vatthu kāma, the basis on which clinging depends. All dhammas
other than lokuttara dhammas are vatthu kāma, they are the basis of
clinging. 

The “Atthasālinī” (§ 61-63) uses several methods to
explain the meaning of kāmāvacara citta. According to the first
explanation, kāmāvacara citta is the citta of the grade or plane of
sensuousness, kāma; it is not free from kāma, sensuousness. According to
the second method, kāmāvacara citta is the citta which frequents,
“travels” to the sensuous planes of existence: the four unhappy
planes,[^178] the human plane and the six classes of heavenly
planes (of the devas). According to the third explanation, kāmāvacara
citta is so called because it attends to, frequents, the sense objects:
visible object, sound, odour, flavour and tangible object. Since the
citta takes these sense objects as its objects of experience, citta is
called kāmāvacara citta.

It is easy to understand that any citta that is involved
in sense objects, thus, visible object and the other sense objects, is
kāmāvacara citta. 

Questioner: Does the arahat have kāmāvacara citta?

Sujin: Yes. When the arahat sees visible object that
appears through the eyes, the citta that sees is kāmāvacara citta,
because visible object is a sense object. Whenever citta experiences
visible object and the other sense objects, it is kāmāvacara citta, no
matter whether it is the citta of the Buddha, an arahat disciple or
anybody else.

According to the fourth method of explanation, citta is
kāmāvacara citta because it causes rebirths in sensuous planes of
existence, namely the four unhappy planes, the human plane and the six
classes of heavenly planes.

All of us here are in the human plane, because
kāmāvacara kusala citta has conditioned kāmāvacara vipākacitta to
perform the function of rebirth in the human plane, which is a sensuous
plane of existence.

Someone may develop samatha to the degree of attainment
concentration (appanā samādhi) and attain rūpa-jhāna or arūpa-jhāna. If
he does not lose his skill in jhāna and jhānacitta arises just before
the dying-consciousness, the jhānacitta does not condition rebirth in
this world but in a rūpa-brahma plane or an arūpa-brahma plane,
depending on the degree of jhāna. Rebirth as a human being is the result
of kāmāvacara kusala citta that performs dāna, generosity, observes
sīla, morality, develops samatha or vipassanā. These ways of kusala,
performed by kusala citta of the sense-sphere, citta that is not free
from kāma, have rebirth in sensuous planes of existence as a result.

The term bhūmi, base or plane, has two different
meanings: plane or grade of citta and plane of existence. As to the
first meaning, bhūmi designates the citta that is the base or foundation
for the accompanying dhammas (sampayutta dhammas), all cetasikas that
arise together with the citta. As we have seen, we can classify cittas
by way of four bhūmis or planes of citta: the cittas of the
sense-sphere, kāmāvacara cittas, rūpa-jhānacittas, arūpa-jhānacittas and
lokuttara cittas. As to the second meaning of bhūmi, this designates the
plane of existence, the situation or place where a living being is born.
The human world is one bhūmi, a plane where one is born. It is one plane
among thirty-one planes of existence.

Citta is variegated. There are different types of citta
and even cittas of the same type are varied. Kāmāvacara kusala cittas
that arise are varied because the accompanying cetasikas are different
and have different intensities, such as saddhā, confidence in kusala,
which can be of different intensities, and paññā which can be of
different levels. There is a great variety of the accompanying
cetasikas. Thus, their result is rebirth in different happy planes, not
only in the human plane. 

When one commits akusala kamma, it can be noticed that
akusala kammas are of different degrees, they can be more serious or
they can be of a lesser degree. Sometimes there may be a great deal of
hate or vengefulness, sometimes there may not be so much aversion.
Sometimes one does not make a great effort to hurt or kill other beings;
the intention to kill may not be very strong, and moreover, only tiny
beings may die as a consequence of one’s effort to kill. Since the
different akusala kammas are performed by cittas that are accompanied by
various cetasikas of different intensities, their results are varied, in
the form of vipākacittas performing the function of rebirth in four
different classes of unhappy planes. Since both kusala kamma and akusala
kamma are variegated, causing variegated results, there must be many
different planes where there can be rebirth. Besides the human plane,
there are other planes of existence.
