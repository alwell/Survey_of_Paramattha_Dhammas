# Associated Dhammas

Cittas can be classified by way of different associated
dhammas, sampayutta dhammas, and these are the accompanying cetasikas
that cause them to be variegated. Cittas can be classified as
sampayutta, associated with particular cetasikas, and as vippayutta,
disassociated from them. When cittas are differentiated by this way of
classification, five particular cetasikas are referred to, namely wrong
view (diṭṭhi), aversion (dosa), doubt (vicikicchā), restlessness
(uddhacca) and wisdom, paññā. Four of these cetasikas are akusala and
one is sobhana. As regards the akusala cetasikas citta can be
associated with, there is the following classification:

- diṭṭhigata-sampayutta: citta associated with diṭṭhi cetasika,
 wrong view; 
- paṭigha-sampayutta: citta associated with dosa cetasika; 
- vicikicchā-sampayutta: citta associated with vicikicchā cetasika,
 doubt about realities; 
- uddhacca-sampayutta: citta associated with uddhacca cetasika,
 restlessness. 



As regards the sobhana cetasika citta can be associated
with, there is the following classification: ñāna-sampayutta, citta
associated with paññā cetasika.

The twelve types of akusala cittas which will be dealt
with hereafter can be classified as associated, sampayutta, and
dissociated, vippayutta, in the following way: of the eight types of
lobha-mūla-citta, four types are associated with wrong view,
diṭṭhigata-sampayutta; and four types are dissociated from wrong view,
diṭṭhigata-vippayutta.

The two types of dosa-mūla-citta are associated with
paṭigha, which is dosa cetasika, the reality that is coarse and harsh.

One type of moha-mūla-citta is associated with doubt,
vicikicchā-sampayutta, and one type is associated with restlessness,
uddhacca-sampayutta.

Thus, of the twelve types of akusala citta, eight types
are sampayutta and four types are vippayutta.

The lobha-mūla-cittas that are associated with and
dissociated from wrong view can be differentiated because of the
accompanying feelings. Two of the four types that are associated with
wrong view are accompanied by pleasant feeling and two types by
indifferent feeling. Even so, two of the four types that are dissociated
from wrong view are accompanied by pleasant feeling and two types by
indifferent feeling.

Moreover, there is still another differentiation to be
made. Lobha-mūla-cittas can arise without being prompted, asaṅkhārika,
and they can arise because they are prompted,
sasaṅkhārika.[^191] Four types are unprompted and four types are
prompted. The eight lobha-mūla-cittas are classified as follows:

1. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wrong view, unprompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
2. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wrong view, prompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
3. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wrong view, unprompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-vippayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
4. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wrong view, prompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-vippayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
5. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wrong view, unprompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ.
6. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wrong view, prompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
7. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wrong view, unprompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-vippayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
8. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wrong view, prompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-vippayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 



The two types of dosa-mūla-citta are associated with
paṭigha, repulsion or anger, which is actually dosa cetasika, and, thus,
they are both paṭigha-sampayutta. When there is unpleasant feeling, it
is each time accompanied by dosa cetasika, the dhamma that is coarse,
harsh and vexatious. The characteristic of unpleasant feeling is quite
different from pleasant feeling and indifferent feeling. The two types
of dosa-mūla-citta, which are both paṭigha-sampayutta, are accompanied
by unpleasant feeling. The two types of dosa-mūla-citta are different in
as far as one type is asaṅkhārika, unprompted, without instigation, and
one type is sasaṅkhārika, prompted. They are classified as follows:

1. Accompanied by unpleasant feeling, with anger, unprompted
 (domanassa-sahagataṃ, paṭigha-sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
2. Accompanied by unpleasant feeling, with anger, prompted
 (domanassa-sahagataṃ, paṭigha-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 



There are two types of moha-mūla-citta. One of them is
vicikicchā-sampayutta, accompanied by doubt (vicikicchā cetasika), which
doubts about the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, the khandhas, the
dhātus (elements), the past, the present, the future and other matters.
The second type of moha-mūla-citta is called uddhacca-sampayutta,
accompanied by restlessness.

Moha cetasika (ignorance) does not know realities as
they are. Moha experiences an object, it is confronted with an object
but it is unable to know the true characteristic of the object that
appears. For example, when one is seeing now, one may not know that what
appears through the eyes is just a rūpa, a kind of reality. There may
also be doubt about realities. One may doubt whether it is true that one
does not see people or things, as one always believed, but only a rūpa,
appearing through the eyesense. Doubt does not arise all the time, but
whenever there is doubt about the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha and
about the characteristics of realities that appear, there is
moha-mūla-citta vicikicchā-sampayutta. 

When we have seen, heard, smelt, tasted or experienced
tangible object through the bodysense, the javanacittas that follow,
when the cittas are not kusala, are often moha-mūla-cittas which are
uddhacca-sampayutta, accompanied by restlessness. These types arise when
the akusala citta is not accompanied by lobha cetasika, dosa cetasika or
vicikicchā cetasika (doubt). Then we can know the characteristic of
moha-mūla-citta that is uddhacca-sampayutta, arising when we are
forgetful of realities and do not know the characteristic of the object
that appears.[^192]

The two types of moha-mūla-citta are classified as
follows:

1. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with doubt (upekkhā-sahagataṃ,
 vicikicchā-sampayuttaṃ). 
2. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with restlessness
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, uddhacca-sampayuttaṃ). 



As we have seen, of the twelve types of akusala cittas,
eight types are sampayutta, and four types are vippayutta.

As regards sobhana (beautiful) cittas, associated with
paññā cetasika, these are called ñāṇa-sampayutta (ñāṇa is paññā
cetasika). 

Cittas can be differentiated as unprompted, asaṅkhārika,
or prompted, sasaṅkhārika. The term “saṅkhāra” which is used in the
Tipiṭaka has several meanings. It is used in the following composite
words: saṅkhāra dhammas, saṅkhārakkhandha, abhisaṅkhāra, as well as
asaṅkhārika and sasaṅkhārika. In each of these cases, saṅkhāra has a
different meaning. 

Saṅkhāra dhammas are dhammas that arise because of their
appropriate conditions. When they have arisen, they fall away again. All
saṅkhāra dhammas are impermanent. There are four paramattha dhammas:
citta, cetasika, rūpa and nibbāna. The three paramattha dhammas that are
citta, cetasika and rūpa are saṅkhāra dhammas; they arise because of
conditions, they are present for an extremely short moment and then they
fall away completely. Nibbāna is not dependent on conditions, it is the
dhamma that does not arise and fall away. Nibbāna is the unconditioned
dhamma (visaṅkhāra dhamma). 

The three saṅkhāra dhammas that are citta, cetasika and
rūpa can be classified as five khandhas:

- rūpakkhandha, all rūpas;
- vedanākkhandha, feeling, vedanā cetasika;
- saññākkhandha, remembrance or perception, saññā cetasika; 
- saṅkhārakkhandha, “formations”, the other fifty cetasikas; 
- viññāṇakkhandha, all cittas.



As regards saṅkhārakkhandha, this comprises the
cetasikas other than vedanā and saññā, that is, fifty cetasikas. As
regards saṅkhāra dhammas, these are all cittas, or eighty-nine cittas,
all cetasikas, or fifty-two cetasikas, and all rūpas, or twenty-eight
rūpas.

Saṅkhāra dhamma includes more realities than
saṅkhārakkhandha: all cittas, cetasikas and rūpas are saṅkhāra dhammas,
whereas only fifty cetasikas are saṅkhārakkhandha.

Among the fifty cetasikas that are saṅkhārakkhandha,
volition or cetanā cetasika, is preponderant; it is foremost as
kamma-condition. It is “abhisaṅkhāra”; abhi is sometimes used in the
sense of preponderance. In the “Dependent Origination”
(Paticcasamuppāda), ignorance, avijjā, conditions saṅkhāra and saṅkhāra
conditions viññāṇa. Saṅkhāra as a factor of the Dependent Origination
refers to cetanā cetasika, which is abhisaṅkhāra, the dhamma that is
foremost in conditioning, as “kamma formation”. It is actually kusala
kamma or akusala kamma which conditions the arising of result in the
form of vipākacitta, referred to as viññāṇa in the Dependent
Origination. It is true that the other cetasikas are also conditions for
the arising of citta. Phassa cetasika, contact, is for example, an
important condition. If there were no phassa cetasika, which contacts an
object, there could not be cittas that see, hear, smell, taste,
experience tangible object or think about different matters.

However, phassa is not abhisaṅkhāra. It only contacts the object and
then it falls away completely.

Thus, among the fifty cetasikas that are
saṅkhārakkhandha, only cetanā cetasika is abhisaṅkhāra: cetanā that is
kusala kamma or akusala kamma is a foremost condition, it is
kamma-condition for the arising of vipākacitta.

Saṅkhāra as a factor of the Dependent Origination is
threefold:

- meritorious kamma formation, puññ’ābhisaṅkhāra (puññā is merit,
 kusala);
- demeritorious kamma formation, apuññ’ābhisaṅkhāra; 
- imperturbable kamma formation, aneñj’ābhisaṅkhāra. 



Meritorious kamma formation is cetanā cetasika arising
with kāmāvacara kusala citta and rūpāvacara kusala citta. Demeritorious
kamma formation is cetanā cetasika arising with akusala citta.
Imperturbable kamma formation is cetanā cetasika arising with
arūpāvacara kusala citta, and this is kusala citta that is firm and
unshakable.

Kāmāvacara kusala citta (of the sense sphere) arises
only for a very short moment and this kind of kusala is not unshakable.
It arises merely seven times in one process.[^193] It is only
occasionally that there is dāna, abstention from akusala or the
development of other kinds of kusala. When there is no such opportunity,
akusala citta arises very often, during many processes. Rūpāvacara
kusala citta is kusala citta that is ñāṇa-sampayutta, accompanied by
paññā cetasika. It is the citta that has reached calm to the stage of
appanā samādhi, attainment concentration or jhāna. Rūpāvacara citta is
mahaggata kusala, kusala which “has reached greatness”, which is
sublime. However, it is still close to kāmāvacara kusala, since it has
an object connected with rūpa. 

Imperturbable kamma formation is cetanā arising with
arūpa-jhānacitta. This citta is of the same type as the fifth
rūpa-jhānacitta,[^194] but it has an object that is immaterial,
not connected with rūpa, and therefore it is more refined; it is
unshakable. It produces abundant result; it conditions the

arising of arūpa-jhāna vipākacitta in the arūpa -brahma planes. In these
planes the duration of a lifespan is extremely long, and this is in
conformity with the power of the arūpa-jhāna kusala citta. Birth in a
heavenly plane is a happy birth, because there is in such planes no
disease, pain, bodily ailments or other discomforts such as occur in the
human plane and in the unhappy planes. However, the duration of the
lifespan in heavenly planes is not as long as in the rūpa-brahma planes,
and the lifespan in the rūpa-brahma planes is not as long as in the
arūpa-brahma planes. As we have seen, birth in the latter planes is the
result of cetanā arising with arūpa-jhāna kusala citta. This type of
cetanā or kamma is abhisaṇkhāra that is imperturbable or unshakable,
āneñj’ābhi-saṅkhāra.

Summarizing the meanings of saṅkhāra in different
composite words, they are the following:

- saṅkhāra dhammas, which are citta, cetasika and rūpa; 
- saṅkhārakkhandha, including fifty cetasikas (vedanā and saññā are
 each a separate khandha); 
- abhisaṅkhāra, which is cetanā cetasika, one among the fifty
 cetasikas included in saṅkhārakkhandha. 



In addition, the terms asaṅkhārika and sasaṅkhārika are
used for the differentiation of cittas. Kusala citta, akusala citta,
vipākacitta and kiriyacitta can be without instigation, asaṅkhārika, or
with instigation, sasaṅkhārika. 

We read in the “Atthasālinī” (I, Part IV, Ch V, 156)
that sasaṅkhārika means “with effort” or “with instigation”. The
instigation can come from oneself or from someone else. Someone else may
urge one or order one to do something. It is the nature of citta as it
naturally arises in daily life to be asaṅkhārika or sasaṅkhārika. No
matter whether the citta is kusala or akusala, sometimes it arises of
its own accord, because of accumulations that have been formed in the
past and are thus a strong condition for its arising. Then it has the
strength to arise spontaneously, independent of any instigation. The
nature of such a citta is asaṅkhārika. Sometimes kusala citta or akusala
citta that arises is weak, it can only arise when there is instigation
by oneself or by someone else. Then the citta is sasaṅkhārika. Thus we
see that kusala citta and akusala citta have different strengths, as
they are asaṅkhārika and sasaṅkhārika. 

Sometimes akusala citta is strong, it arises immediately
because of accumulated like or dislike of the object that is experienced
at that moment. Sometimes this is not the case. For example, someone may
have no inclination at all to go to the cinema or theatre. However, when
members of his family or friends urge him to go, he will go. Does the
citta at such a moment really like to go? Someone may be indifferent to
go or not to go, but if people urge him, he will go. If he were on his
own, he would not go. Sometimes one may think that a particular film is
worth seeing and enjoyable, but one still does not go because one does
not have the energy, one does not feel the urgency to go immediately.
This is reality in daily life. We can find out when there is citta with
strength and when there is citta that is weak, no matter whether it
concerns akusala, such as lobha and dosa, or kusala. Some people, when
they have heard that there is a “Kaṭhina” ceremony, the offering of
robes to the monks after the rainy season, want to attend immediately
and they also urge others to attend. Some people, when they hear that
this or that particular person will not attend a ceremony, may decide
not to go, even though they have been urged to go. Thus, kusala citta as
well as akusala citta have different degrees of strength and this
depends on the conditions for their arising. 

The Buddha explained that particular cittas can be
asaṅkhārika or sasaṅkhārika in order to show us how intricate citta is.
Cittas that arise may be accompanied by the same cetasikas, but the
nature of these cittas can be different in as far as they are
asaṅkhārika or sasaṅkhārika, depending on the strength of the
accompanying cetasikas. The Buddha taught the Dhamma in detail and this
shows his great compassion. 

We read in the “Atthasālinī” (Book I, Part IV, Ch VIII,
160, 161) about four “Infinites”, namely, space, world-systems, groups
of sentient beings and the knowledge of a Buddha:

> 1. "There is, indeed, no limit to space reckoned as so many hundreds,
thousands, or hundred thousands of yojanas (one yojana being 16
kilometres) to east, west, north or south. If an iron peak of the size
of Mount Meru were to be thrown downwards, dividing the earth in two, it
would go on falling and would not get a footing. Thus infinite is space.

> 2. There is no limit to the world-systems reckoning by hundreds or
thousands of yojanas. If the four great Brahmās, born in the Akaniṭṭha
mansion (the highest rūpa-brahma plane), endowed with speed, and capable
of traversing a hundred thousand world-systems during the time that a
light arrow shot by a strong archer would take to travel across the
shadow of a palmyra tree, were with such speed to run in order to see
the limit of the world-systems, they would pass away without
accomplishing their purpose. Thus the world-systems are infinite.

> 3. In so many world-systems there is no limit to beings, belonging to
land and water. Thus infinite are the groups of beings.

> 4. More infinite than these is a Buddha’s knowledge.”

With regard to infinite space, nobody can measure how
many hundreds, thousands or hundreds of thousands yojanas space is.
Neither can one count the world-systems. If one were to count the stars
and the world-systems, one would never be able to finish, the
world-systems are infinite. One cannot determine the number of living
beings of all the different groups that live in the world-systems: the
human beings, devas, brahmas, animals living on land or in the water,
all beings in the unhappy planes. The wisdom of the Buddha is called
infinite, there are no limits to it and it is more infinite than the
other three infinites.

When we think of all beings that live in the countless
world systems, the diversity of the cittas of all those beings must be
endless. With regard to one individual there is a great variety of
cittas, even of one class of citta, such as kāmāvacara kusala citta.
Every citta arises only once, it is unique. The same type arises again
but it is then a different citta. When we take into consideration the
cittas of innumerable beings, we cannot imagine the variety of even one
type of citta arising for living beings in the different planes.

The “Atthasālinī” states as to the type of kāmāvacara
kusala citta, accompanied by pleasant feeling, associated with paññā,
which is asaṅkhārika, thus, powerful, that it is classified as one type
among the eight types of kāmāvacara kusala cittas. This is classified as
just one type, although there is an endless variety even of this type of
kāmāvacara kusala citta for one being and even more so for countless
other beings. 

Further on, we read in the “Atthasālinī” with regard to
the classification of the kāmāvacara kusala cittas as eight types:

“Now, all these classes of kāmāvacara kusala citta arising in the
countless beings in the countless world systems, the Supreme Buddha, as
though weighing them in a great balance, or measuring them by putting
them in a measure, has classified by means of his omniscience, and has
shown them to be eight, making them into eight similar groups.”

This classification as eight types of
mahā-kusala[^195] cittas is in accordance with the truth. They
are classified as eight types: they can be accompanied by pleasant
feeling, somanassa vedanā, or by indifferent feeling, upekkhā vedanā,
accompanied by paññā or without paññā, asaṅkhārika or sasaṅkhārika.
Summarizing them, they are:

1. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wisdom, unprompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
2. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wisdom, prompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
3. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wisdom, unprompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-vippayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
4. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wisdom, prompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-vippayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
5. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wisdom, unprompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
6. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wisdom, prompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
7. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wisdom, unprompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-vippayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
8. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wisdom, prompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-vippayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 


Do we at times feel tired and bored, without energy?
Sometimes the citta thinks of performing a particular kind of kusala,
but then it is too weak, and fatigue and boredom arise. Can sati at such
moments be aware of the characteristic of citta that is weak and without
energy for kusala? If there is no awareness, there is a concept of self
who feels that way. Fatigue, weakness, boredom, a feeling of being
downcast, in low spirits and without energy, all such moments are real.
If sati is not aware of the characteristics of such realities as they
naturally appear, it will not be known that they are not a living being,
not a person, not a self. They are only characteristics of citta that
arises because of conditions and then falls away again.

The Buddha explained citta under many different aspects.
One of these aspects is the classification of citta as asaṅkhārika and
sasaṅkhārika. Lobha-mūla-citta can be asaṅkhārika or sasaṅkhārika. Also,
dosa-mūla-citta and kusala citta can be asaṅkhārika or sasaṅkhārika.
When sati can be aware of the characteristics of these realities, they
can be known as nāma, different from rūpa. A feeling of being downcast
or disheartened, of being in low spirits, without energy for kusala, is
not rūpa. It is the nature of citta that is sasaṅkhārika, there is at
such moments a citta that is weak.

Cittas differentiated as asaṅkhārika and sasaṅkhārika
can only be kāmāvacara cittas. Kāmāvacara cittas are of the lowest grade
of citta. These are cittas that usually arise in daily life, when there
is seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, experiencing tangible object or
thinking about the sense objects. The kusala cittas or akusala cittas
which arise on account of the sense objects sometimes have strength and,
thus, arise spontaneously, and sometimes they are weak and arise with
instigation. It all depends on conditions. 

The cittas that are of a higher grade, namely,
rūpāvacara cittas, arūpāvacara cittas and lokuttara cittas, are not
classified by way of asaṅkhārika and sasaṅkhārika. All of them are
prompted, sasaṅkhārika. The reason for this is that they are dependent
on the appropriate development as a necessary condition for their
arising. In this context, being sasaṅkhārika does not mean that they are
weak, such as in the case of kāmāvacara cittas that are prompted,
sasaṅkharika. Before rūpāvacara citta, arūpāvacara citta and lokuttara
kusala citta arise, there must be kāmāvacara kusala citta accompanied by
paññā each time. This is a necessary factor that induces or prompts
their arising. Therefore, the cittas of the higher planes, rūpāvacara
cittas, arūpāvacara cittas and lokuttara cittas are each time
sasaṅkhārika and ñāṇa-sampayutta, accompanied by paññā. 

We can come to know whether cittas in different
circumstances of our daily life are asaṅkhārika or sasaṅkhārika. When
we, for example, come to listen to the Dhamma, do we need to be urged by
someone else? At first, we may not want to come of our own accord, we
need to be urged. However, later on we come of our own accord, without
being urged. In each of these cases the nature of citta is different,
being sasaṅkhārika or asaṅkhārika. The citta is not all the time
sasaṅkhārika or all the time asaṅkhārika. One may, for example, go to
the cinema after having been urged, and, thus, the cittas are weak.
However, afterwards, when one sits comfortably, one may enjoy oneself,
one may be amused and laugh, and then the cittas are not weak, because
one does not need any instigation to laugh or to have fun. While one
enjoys oneself and laughs, the cittas with pleasant feeling are strong,
arising of their own accord; they are asaṅkhārika. This shows us that
citta is each time anattā, that it arises because of its own conditions.
The citta that arises at this moment may be this way, the next moment it
is different again, depending on conditions.
