# Concepts (II)

The “Atthasālinī” (II, Part II, 400) explains about
being unguarded as to the “controlling faculties,” the indriyas. Here,
the indriyas of eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind are
referred to. We read:

> “Grasps the general appearance, i.e., grasps by way of lusting, desire a
sign such as is of the male, or female, pleasant, etc., and which is the
basis of corruption.”

When we cling to the general appearance of male or
female, it shows that the object is not a paramattha dhamma. When we
know that we see a man or woman, we don’t just know the reality that
appears through the eyes, but we have an image (nimitta), a concept on
account of what appears through the eyes. The image of the general
appearance of a man or woman is the foundation of
defilements.[^234] Through the power of desire (chanda raga) we
take that image for something attractive. When we like a concept such as
a belt, it shows that the belt is an attractive image. One is attached
to it, one is ruled by desire. If the belt is not beautiful, if it is
not an attractive image (nimitta), one does not like it. On account of
colours that appear through the eyes, there can be different “nimittas”,
attractive or unattractive. 

We read further on in the “Atthāsalinī”:

> “Grasps the details (anuvyañjana), i.e., takes the various modes of
hands and feet, of smiling, laughing, speaking, looking straight ahead,
looking askance, which have earned the name of ‘details’ from the
manifesting, the revealing of the lower nature.”

The “details” are the condition that causes defilements
to appear. When someone likes a belt, he likes the general appearance,
the image, and the details. If all belts were the same, if there were no
variety of them, the details would not be different. However, there are
many kinds of belts and they are different as to the details. The
details condition the arising of different kinds of defilements.

Questioner: If we don’t cling to concepts, I fear that
we will not know that this is a pen.

Sujin: That is not so. We should know realities in
accordance with the truth. What appears through the eyes falls away, and
then there are mind-door process cittas, which arise afterwards and know
a concept. Paññā (wisdom) should know realities as they are. It should
know what is visible object, which appears through the eye-door. It
should know that the experience of visible object is different from the
moment that citta knows a concept. Thus we can become detached from the
idea that visible object that appears are beings, people, or things; we
can become detached from that which is the foundation of clinging. We
should understand that when it is known that there is a man, a woman,
beings, or different people, the object is an image or concept known
through the mind-door. When we develop satipaṭṭhāna, we should know the
characteristics of the realities just as they naturally appear, in order
to be able to realize the arising and falling away of nāma and rūpa. It
should be known that paramattha dhammas are not concepts. One should
continue to develop paññā when realities appear through eyes, ears,
nose, tongue, bodysense, and mind-door.

Questioner: Did you say that a concept is a kind of
dhammārammaṇa (mind-door object)?

Sujin: A concept is dhammārammaṇa. It is an object that
can only be known through the mind-door.

Questioner: Are there also paramattha dhammas (ultimate
realities) which are dhammārammaṇa?

Sujin: There are six classes of
dhammārammaṇa.[^235] Five classes are paramattha dhammas and one
class is not paramattha dhamma. We should know when an object is a
concept. When an object is not a paramattha dhamma, the object is a
concept.

When we think of concepts in daily life, the
characteristics of the paramattha dhammas, which are experienced through
the six doors, are hidden. Thus, realities are not known as they are.
One does not know that what appears through the eyes is not a being,
person or self. It is only colour that appears when it impinges on the
eyesense. When will paññā become keener so that it will know the truth
when there is seeing?

When the truth is known, we will let go of the idea that
there is a self, that there are beings or people. One will be able to
distinguish between the object which is a paramattha dhamma and the
object which is a concept and one will have right understanding of the
realities which appear through the six doors.

Questioner: Which object is experienced while we are
dreaming?

Sujin: Everyone, except an arahat, is sure to dream.
When we wake up, we say that in our dream we saw a relative who passed
away. While we were dreaming, did we see a concept or a paramattha
dhamma? If we do not consider this, we will not know the truth. It seems
as if we can really see in our dreams. However, if we ask someone what
he sees in his dreams, he will answer that he sees people, relatives and
friends, that he sees different beings. Thus, when we dream, we “see”
concepts. At such moments, the eye-door process cittas do not arise
because we are asleep. However, cittas arising in the mind-door process
are thinking, they “see” beings and people. When we are dreaming we
think of concepts that are conceived on account of what we formerly saw,
heard or experienced through the other senses. 

Also, when we read about different subjects in the
newspaper and see pictures, we only think of concepts; we don’t know the
characteristics of paramattha dhammas (ultimate realities) that appear.
We don’t know the difference between concepts and paramattha dhammas.
When we read or perform our tasks in daily life, there is seeing of what
appears through the eyes, but we pay attention only to concepts and keep
on thinking of them.

Concepts are conceived on account of what was heard. A
small child often hears sounds but it does not yet know words; it does
not understand conventional language. It sees, hears, smells, tastes,
experiences tangible object, it experiences pain, it is angry, it has
likes and dislikes, and it cries. However, it does not know words with
which it can explain its feelings, it cannot speak yet until it has
become older. Can anybody remember all that has happened from the moment
he was born? Seeing, hearing, and other sense-cognitions arose but we
could not use words to express ourselves since we did not yet understand
the meaning of the different sounds used in speech. That is why the
memory of the events of early childhood fades away. When we grow up we
know the meaning of the different sounds which form up words in current
speech, which are used to express ourselves. We take in more and more
impressions through eyes and ears and combine these experiences, and
thus many kinds of events of our lives can be remembered. The world of
conventional truth expands and there is no end to its development.

When one reads a story one also wants to see a moving
picture of it and hear the corresponding sounds. We should realize to
what extent the world of conventional truth hides realities, paramattha
dhammas. We should consider what are concepts, not paramattha dhammas,
when we, for example, watch television, when we watch a play and look at
people talking. It seems that the people who play in a film on
television are real people, but the story and the people who play in it
are only concepts. The paramattha dhammas that appear fall away very
rapidly and then they are succeeded by other realities. When we know
that there is a particular person, the object of the citta is a concept.

The characteristics of paramattha dhammas are hidden
because of ignorance, avijjā, which does not know the difference between
paramattha dhammas and concepts, paññattis. Therefore, one is not able
to realize that the realities appearing through the eyes, ears, nose,
tongue, bodysense and mind-door are not beings, a person, or self. If we
study citta, cetasika (mental factors), and rūpa in more and more
detail, the intellectual understanding of the Dhamma will develop. This
understanding is accumulated and thus conditions are developed for the
arising of sati (mindfulness) which can be directly aware of the
characteristics of paramattha dhammas. Thus, there can be more
detachment from the outward appearance (nimitta) and the details
(anuvyañjana) which are forms of paññatti.

Questioner: Can a concept be an object of satipaṭṭhāna?

Sujin: It cannot.

Questioner: From what I heard just a moment ago, it
seems that a concept can be the object of satipaṭṭhāna.

Sujin: Only paramattha dhammas can be the object of
satipaṭṭhāna. When flavour impinges on the rūpa that is tasting-sense,
there are conditions for the arising of cittas that experience flavour
through the tongue-door. First, there is the five-sense-door
adverting-consciousness and then there are tasting-consciousness,
receiving-consciousness, investigating-consciousness,
determi-ning-consciousness, the javana-cittas and the tadālambana-cittas
(registering or retention). Then the flavour falls away and, thus, there
is no grape in the absolute sense. However, when one joins different
realities together into a whole, such as a grape, then the object is a
concept.

Satipaṭṭhāna is developed when there is awareness of the
characteristics of paramattha dhammas and they are realized as not a
being, a person or self. When sati does not arise, the characteristics
of paramattha dhammas cannot be discerned, only concepts are known.
Then, there will be ideas of beings, people and self all the time.

Questioner: You said that concepts could be known
through the mind-door. Therefore, I am inclined to think that if there
is awareness through the mind-door, concepts can be the object of
satipaṭṭhāna.

Sujin: In order to have more understanding of
satipaṭṭhāna, we should begin with this very moment. Is there a concept
while you hear sound now? Sound is a paramattha dhamma. When citta knows
the meaning of the sound it knows a concept and it knows this through
the mind-door. Citta thinks about different words. Sati can follow and
be aware of that citta, so that it can be realized as just a type of
citta that thinks of words.

Questioner: Thus, satipaṭṭhāna can know the reality that
is thinking, but it cannot know concepts. As far as I understand, each
of the sense-door processes has to be followed by a mind-door process,
it cannot be otherwise. When there is seeing there is an eye-door
process, and after there have been bhavanga-cittas in between, there is
a mind-door process of cittas which experience visible object. Is that
right?

Sujin: The vīthi-cittas of the mind-door process, which
follow vīthi-cittas of a sense-door process, have to experience the same
rūpa. If the javana-cittas of the sense-door process are
lobha-mūla-cittas[^236] (cittas rooted in attachment), the
javana-cittas of the first mind-door process after that sense-door
process have to be the same types of lobha-mūla-citta. The mind-door
process follows extremely rapidly upon the sense-door process. With
respect to this, there is a simile of a bird perching on a branch. As
soon as the bird perches on the branch, its shadow appears on the
ground. Even so, when the object has been experienced through the
sense-door and there have been many bhavanga-cittas in between, arising
and falling away very rapidly, it is immediately afterwards experienced
through the mind-door. Since cittas succeed one another so rapidly, one
does not know that visible object which is experienced through the eyes
is only a paramattha dhamma that can appear because it has impinged on
the eye-sense.

Questioner: When there is seeing through the eyes and we
know that it is a pen, it shows that we know the word pen through the
mind-door. Is that right?

Sujin: Before we can think of the word pen, we already
know a concept. A paññatti is not merely sadda paññatti, a concept of
sound, a word or name.

Questioner: After seeing I remember what was seen. Is
the object then already a concept?

Sujin: The Pāli term paññatti means: it makes something
known (derived from paññāpeti).    

Questioner: Must each of the sense-door processes be
followed by a mind-door process?

Sujin: The five sense objects, which are visible object,
sound, odour, flavour, and tangible object, appear through two doorways.
Thus, visible object appears through the eye-door and then, after there
have been bhavanga-cittas in between, it appears through the mind-door.
In the same way, sound, odour, flavour, and tangible object appear
through the corresponding sense-doors and then through the mind-door.

Questioner: When we taste a sour flavour and we notice
that it is sour, do we experience a concept?

Sujin: What is sour?

Questioner: For example, a sour orange we eat.

Sujin: The flavour is a paramattha dhamma, and when we
think of a sour orange, the object is a concept. The words sour oranges
are “sadda paññatti” (“sadda” meaning sound or word). When we name
something, the object is nāma paññatti, a concept that is a name. If
there were no sounds, there would be no words, and we would not think of
the meaning of things; we would not pay much attention to objects. When
sound is the object of cittas of the ear-door process, and then of
cittas of the mind-door process, saññā (remembrance), which remembers
the meaning of the different sounds, conditions thinking about words and
names.

Everything can be called by a name, such as a pen, a
pencil, a table or a chair; these are all names. There is no dhamma that
cannot be called by a name. Since dhammas have distinctive
characteristics, names are needed to make these known. Thus, dhammas are
the cause of name giving. The “Atthasālinī” (Book II, Part II, Ch. II,
391) describes the process of name giving. We read:

>  “There is no being, no thing that may not be called by a name. Also,
the trees in the forest, the mountains are the business of the country
folk. For they, on being asked, ‘What tree is this?’ say the name they
know, as ‘Cutch,’ ‘Mango tree.’ Even of the tree, the name of which they
know not, they say, ‘It is the nameless tree.’ And that also stands as
the established name of that tree...”

If there were no names, it would be most difficult for
people to understand one another. Even paramattha dhammas need to be
named. The Buddha used concepts to classify dhammas according to their
characteristics, such as the following names:

- The five khandhas, 
- The twelve āyatanas, 
- The eighteen elements, 
- The four noble Truths,[^237] 
- The twenty two indriyas,[^238] 
- The different groups of people (puggala). 



Thus, the Dhamma the Buddha taught needs different terms
and names in order to be understood.

The “Atthasālinī” uses different synonyms for nāma
paññatti, concepts that are names.[^239] It is an
interpretation, an expression that renders the meaning of something in
language (nirutti). A name is a distinctive sign that shows the meaning
of something (vyañcana). There are sounds which people utter, sounds
combined as words which express the meaning of something (abhilāpa,
meaning, phrasing or expression). These synonyms explain the meaning of
nāma paññatti, a name or term. A term makes the meaning of something
known. The idea or notion that is made known can also be called a
concept. Thus, there are, generally speaking, two kinds of paññatti:

1. That which is made known (paññāpiyattā or atthapaññatti). 
2. That which makes known (paññāpanato), the name or term (sadda
 paññatti or nāma paññatti) which makes known the meaning of things.
 

If we remember these two classes of concepts, it will be
easier to understand what a concept is. There are many kinds of concepts
and they can be classified in different ways. One way of classifying
them is the following (see also “Abhidhammattha Sangaha” Ch. VIII,
section 4, on paññattis):

1. concept of continuity: (saṇṭhāna paññatti), corresponding to the
 continuity of things, such as land, mountain or tree, which concept
 is based on the rapid succession of the elements.
2. collective concept: (samūha paññatti), corresponding to modes of
 construction of materials, to a collection of things, such as a
 vehicle or a chariot. 
3. conventional concept: (sammutti paññatti), such as person or
 individual, which is derived from the five khandhas.
4. local concept: (disā paññatti), a notion or idea derived from the
 revolving of the moon, such as the directions of east or west.
5. concept of time: (kāla paññatti), such as morning, evening.
6. concept of season: (māsa paññatti), notions corresponding to
 seasons and months. The months are designated by names, such as
 “Vesakha”. 
7. concept of space: (akāsa), such as a well or a cave. It is
 derived from space that is not contacted by the four Great
 Elements.
8. nimitta paññatti: the mental image which is acquired through
 the development of samatha, such as the nimitta of a kasiṇa. 



We read in the “Abhidhammattha Sangaha”:

> “All such different things, although they do not exist in the ultimate
sense, become objects of thought in the form of shadows of (ultimate)
things. They are called paññatti because they are thought of, reckoned,
understood, expressed, and made known on account of, in consideration
of, and with respect to, this or that mode. This paññatti is so called
because it is made known. As it makes known, it is called ‘paññatti’. It
is described as ‘name’, ‘name-made’, etc.”

Lobha-mūla-citta (consciousness with attachment) arises
time and again through eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and
mind-door. Even when lobha-mūla-citta is without wrong view (diṭṭhigata
vippayutta), it is not merely attached to paramattha dhammas (realities)
which appear through the six doors, but it is also attached to concepts.
It is attached to the general appearance of things and to the details;
it is attached to names and to subjects of thought.

We should ask ourselves, at this moment, what kinds of
objects we usually experience in our daily life? The objects are mostly
concepts and thus the characteristics of paramattha dhammas are hidden,
they are not known as they are.

Questioner: When we touch grapes or a picture of grapes,
softness and hardness[^240] are paramattha dhammas, the flavour
of grapes is a paramattha dhamma. Many realities that are joined
together constitute a real grape and this we call a concept. Thus, I am
inclined to think that a concept is real.

Sujin: The rūpa of flavour arises and then falls away;
it can only last as long as seventeen moments of citta.[^241]
The rūpa that is the colour of grapes arises and then falls away very
rapidly since it only lasts as long as seventeen moments of citta. Can
we then say that grapes exist?

Questioner: They exist in our memory.

Sujin: There is a concept, a notion that there are
grapes, but in reality there is only flavour which arises and then falls
away, or hardness which arises and then falls away.

Questioner: A concept is formed because many paramattha
dhammas are joined together into a mass or a whole.

Sujin: When one does not realize the arising and falling
away of one reality at a time, one takes what appears to be a whole, for
a thing which exists.

Questioner: Is a concept not real? A concept is
constituted of many kinds of paramattha dhammas (realities): softness,
hardness, heat, colour, odour or flavour. They are joined together; they
are a whole, a thing that has such and such colour, this or that shape.
There is a concept of this or that person with such and such outward
appearance. Thus, a concept is made up of paramattha dhammas.

Sujin: One will know that concepts are not paramattha
dhammas if one learns to discern the characteristics of the different
paramattha dhammas that arise together. One should be aware of one
characteristic at a time as it appears through one doorway at a time. In
order to know the truth we should realize the arising and falling away
of rūpa, which appears through one doorway at a time.

Each rūpa lasts only as long as seventeen moments of
citta and then it falls away. Therefore, rūpa that arises has no time to
stand, walk, or do anything. During the time one lifts one’s hand,
already more than seventeen moments of citta have passed. One sees
people walking or lifting their hands, but in reality the rūpas that
arise fall away immediately and are succeeded by other rūpas. The rūpa
which is visible object appears to cittas of the eye-door process and
then, after there have been bhavanga-cittas in between, there are many
mind-door processes of cittas. That is why one can see people walking or
lifting their hands. Seventeen moments of citta pass away extremely
rapidly. Thus, we should consider what happens in reality. 

It should be known that the rūpa appearing at this
moment through the eyes only lasts seventeen moments of citta and that
it must fall away before sound can be experienced through ears. It seems
that there can be hearing and seeing at the same time, but in between
the moment of hearing and the moment of seeing there is an interval of
more than seventeen moments of citta. The visible object, which appears
through the eyes, and lasts seventeen moments of citta, must have fallen
away before the citta that hears arises. 

It seems that there can be hearing and seeing at the
same time, but these are different moments of citta experiencing
different objects. Rūpas arise and fall away and succeed one
another.[^242] Visible object appears through the eye-door and
after there have been bhavanga-cittas in between, it appears through the
mind-door. Then, there are many mind-door processes of cittas that think
of concepts. That is why people who walk, lift their hands or move, can
appear. When we see people lifting their hands or walking, there are
countless nāma dhammas and rūpa dhammas arising and falling away all the
time. So long as we don’t realize the arising and falling away of nāma
and rūpa, we cling to the idea that what appears are people, women, men,
this or that thing. We cling to the concept of somebody or something.

When one studies paramattha dhammas, one should remember
that they are real, that they are not beings, people or self; that they
are not women, men, or different things. The dhammas that are true can
be verified. One may have often heard the words that paramattha dhammas
are real, that they are not beings, people or self, and one may have
repeated these words oneself. However, paññā should be developed to the
stage that the truth can be directly understood. Flavour and hardness
are realities that appear and then, on account of these realities, there
is a concept of grapes. The rūpas that arise and then fall away are real
but there are, in the absolute sense, no grapes, no beings, or people.
There are only rūpa dhammas and nāma dhammas that arise and fall away,
succeeding one another very rapidly. Paramattha dhammas are real; they
are not concepts. 

From the beginning, the practice of the Dhamma should
correspond to the theoretical knowledge acquired through listening and
through study. The practice should be in accordance with the true
characteristics of realities. We have, for example, learned that
paramattha dhammas are anattā (not self), and thus we should try to
understand the meaning of this, even on the theoretical level. We should
consider it and develop paññā so that we can realize the truth in
accordance with what we have learned before.    

Questioner: Someone asked before whether concepts are
real. There is, as you said, absolute truth (paramattha sacca) and
conventional truth (sammutti sacca). Could one not say that concepts are
real in the conventional sense?

Sujin: One can, but one should remember that concepts
are not paramattha dhammas. The idea of grape has no flavour at all.
Flavour is a reality and when it has appeared, we have a concept on
account of it. We have a concept of flavour of grapes and we call it the
flavour of grapes.
