# The Natural Way of Development



Questioner: Among the forty kinds of meditation subjects
of samatha, I prefer “Mindfulness of Breathing.” However, I understand
that by means of this subject, I cannot eradicate defilements, that I
cannot realize the noble Truths and reach nibbāna.

Sujin: Through samatha defilements cannot be eradicated,
nor can the noble Truths be realized and nibbāna be attained. 

Questioner: I think that people’s aim is eradicating
defilements and attaining nibbāna. However, they do not understand what
the cause of clinging is in daily life. They do not know when there is
lobha. If someone just wishes to eradicate defilements without knowing
them as they are, there is clinging to a result. Is it then possible for
them to develop satipaṭṭhāna?

Sujin: No, it is impossible.

Questioner: Can we develop both samatha and vipassanā?

Sujin: People will know for themselves whether they are
developing samatha or vipassanā. However, if there is no right
understanding of these different ways of development, neither samatha
nor vipassanā can be developed. 

Questioner: Could you please give some directions for
the development of vipassanā?

Sujin: Nobody can hasten the development of
satipaṭṭhāna. The goal of satipaṭṭhāna is the eradication of
defilements. However, a person who does not know his defilements is not
motivated to follow the way leading to their eradication. If someone
would line up children who are ignorant of their defilements and tell
them to eradicate defilements by the development of satipaṭṭhāna, they
would not want to eradicate defilements. How could they then develop
satipaṭṭhāna?

All people, children and adults alike, have many
defilements. If one would ask them whether they would wish to get rid of
them, most of them would answer that they do not wish to. Therefore, one
should not try to force others to develop satipaṭṭhāna.

Some people, when they hear about defilements, may not
like to have them, but do they really know their defilements?
Attachment, lobha, is a defilement. Do people want to have lobha? They
may not like the idea of having lobha, but actually, people like lobha
each and every moment. This shows that one does not understand the
characteristic of the defilement of lobha. We can find out whether we
really understand lobha as a defilement or not. Is the food delicious?
Are our clothes and the things with which we beautify ourselves nice? Is
this music pleasing, that odour fragrant, and is the chair soft and
comfortable? Is what we touch agreeable? Although some people do not
like the idea of having lobha and think that they should not have it,
they can find out that citta needs lobha all the time. 

The development of satipaṭṭhāna is the development of
sati and paññā. It is not trying to have concentration, samādhi.

Question: What is attā-saññā, remembrance of self?

Sujin: Attā-saññā is remembrance (saññā) with clinging
to the concept of self (attā), thus, wrong perception of self. We do not
have doubts about attā-saññā because we all are familiar with it. When a
person has realized the noble Truths at the attainment of the first
stage of enlightenment, the stage of the stream-winner (sotāpanna), the
wrong view is eradicated which takes realities for self, for beings or
for people. However, there is bound to be attā-saññā if one has not
developed satipaṭṭhāna. There is bound to be ignorance and wrong view if
sati does not arise, if there is no awareness of the characteristics of
realities as they naturally appear through one doorway at a time. Wrong
view takes the realities that appear for a compound, a “whole,” for
something that lasts, for attā, self. If people at this moment do not
know realities as they are, there is bound to be attā-saññā, the
remembrance or perception that it is “I” who is seeing, and that what is
seen is a being, a person, a self. 

When someone has only theoretical understanding of
realities that is the result of listening to the Dhamma, he is not able
to directly understand nāma and rūpa as they are. He does not realize
that what he sees and conceives as people and beings, is in reality only
that which appears through the eyes. Therefore, we should time and again
investigate the Dhamma we hear and study, we should ponder over it in
all details. Only in this way the meaning of the words that designate
characteristics of realities can be fully understood. 

The wording “that which appears through the eyes”
describing the characteristic of visible object is altogether
appropriate. It explains that visible object is only an element (dhātu)
appearing through the eyes so that it can be seen. No matter what colour
it is: red, green, blue, yellow or white, a bright or a dull colour, it
must appear when it impinges on the rūpa that is eyesense. When someone,
after having seen what appears through the eyesense, does not understand
realities as they are, there is bound to be attā-saññā. He takes what
was seen for people, beings or things. When people are absorbed in
different colours, it causes them to think of a “whole”, of shape and
form, and, thus, there is remembrance (saññā) of the outward appearance
of persons and things. When it seems that one sees people, beings or
things, there are in reality only different colours that are seen, such
as black, white, the colour of skin, red or yellow. 

If people did not interpret different colours or
“translate” them into shape and form, they would not conceive them as
beings, people or things. Therefore, when we see and we are then
absorbed in the shape and form, in the outward appearance (nimitta) and
the details of things, we should know that this occurs only because
colour appears. When colours appear, we think about them, interpret them
and “translate” them into shape and form of different things. 

When sati arises and is mindful of realities and paññā
begins to study and investigate their characteristics, one will begin to
understand that the outward appearance and all the details of things,
all the different colours, are only what appears through the eyes,
nothing else. Then paññā begins to penetrate the characteristics of
realities as not a self, not a being, not a person. If sati arises and
is aware time and again, one will understand the meaning of the Buddha’s
words explaining that, by the development of the understanding of the
realities which naturally appear, one will not cling to the outward
appearance and the details of things. 

We read in the “Middle Length Sayings” (I, no. 27) in
the “Lesser Discourse on the Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint” that
the Buddha spoke to the Brahmin Jāṇussoṇi about the monk’s life. He
spoke about the “restraint of the senses”:

> “He, possessed of the ariyan body of moral habit, subjectively
experiences unsullied well-being. Having seen visible object with the
eye, he is not entranced by the general appearance, he is not entranced
by the detail. If he dwells with this organ of sight uncontrolled,
covetousness and dejection, evil unskilled states of mind might
predominate. So he fares along controlling it; he guards the organ of
sight, he comes to have control over the organ of sight...”

> (The same is said with regard to the other doorways.)

This kind of restraint can be achieved through the
development of paññā that understands the realities that appear as they
are. One will begin to let go of attā-saññā with regard to what appears
through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the bodysense and the
mind-door, in accordance with the degree of paññā that has been reached.

We should remember that no matter which topic or which
detail the teachings deal with, it all concerns the realities of daily
life. Sati should be aware of the realities that appear so that paññā is
able to clearly understand their characteristics. This leads to the
complete eradication of defilements.

We should listen carefully to the Dhamma, we should
study and investigate the dhammas that are already appearing, which are
our ordinary daily life. We cannot yet immediately eradicate lobha,
dosa, moha and the other defilements. People desire to eradicate
defilements, but they should know that defilements can only be
eradicated at the moment of enlightenment, when the magga-citta,
path-consciousness, arises. First, “personality view”, sakkāya-diṭṭhi,
is eradicated, which takes the dhammas appearing through the six doors
for self, being or person. Personality view is eradicated at the first
stage of enlightenment, the stage of the stream-winner, sotāpanna. 

After that stage has been attained, paññā should be
developed further so that the following stages of enlightenment can be
attained and defilements can successively be eradicated. These stages
are the stages of the once-returner, sakadāgāmī, the non-returner,
anāgāmī, and the arahat. Thus, paññā can be developed only gradually.
One should not try to hasten its development, one should not believe
that it is sufficient just to practise for a day, a month or a year,
without even understanding the right conditions for sati. Actually, sati
which is sammā-sati (right mindfulness) of the Eightfold Path can only
arise if one first studies and understands the characteristics of
realities as they appear through the senses and through the mind-door.
Then sammā-sati can arise and be aware, and paññā can begin to
investigate realities that naturally appear in daily life, so that they
can be seen as they really are. 

The development of satipaṭṭhāna is a threefold training
(sikkhā): training in higher morality, adhisīla sikkhā, training in
higher consciousness, adhicitta sikkhā, training in higher wisdom,
adhipaññā sikkhā.

When sati is aware of the realities that are appearing,
there is higher sīla, sīla that is more refined. Sati is aware of the
characteristics of citta, cetasika and rūpa. It is aware of kusala
dhammas and akusala dhammas before actions through the body or through
speech arise.[^324] 

Satipaṭṭhāna is training in higher consciousness, which
means concentration, samādhi or ekaggatā cetasika.[^325] When
sammā-sati arises, there is concentration on the nāma or rūpa that
appears, on the dhamma that arises and falls away very rapidly.

Satipaṭṭhāna is training in higher wisdom, because paññā
investigates and studies in detail the characteristics of realities as
they are appearing in daily life, so that they can be known as they are.


Questioner: Everything you have explained is very
beneficial for me at this moment. But, although I have some
understanding of what I heard, my understanding is not yet sufficient.
When I practise satipaṭṭhāna, I immediately cling to a concept of self
who is making use of sati. I am only a beginner and, as far as I know
myself, I have not even attained the first stage of insight that knows
the difference between the characteristic of nāma and of rūpa,
nāma-rūpa-pariccheda-ñāṇa. What should I do to have more understanding?

Sujin: If someone tries to do something special with the
aim to develop insight, his life will be very complicated. How can he
act in the right way if there is still a concept of self who will do
particular things? If people wish to do particular things in order to
have more understanding, they are clinging. They cling to the
understanding of nāma and rūpa that have arisen already. Satipaṭṭhāna is
the dhamma which is aware of whatever reality appears through one of the
six doors, such as the dhamma appearing through the eyes, visible
object, when there is seeing at this moment. Gradually satipaṭṭhāna can
be aware naturally and paññā can begin to study and investigate the true
nature of nāma and rūpa.

Question: How should we develop satipaṭṭhāna when we are
seeing?

Sujin: When there is seeing, you can be aware and
realize that what appears to seeing is a type of reality which only
appears through the eyes. When we see hairs, a table, a chair, a pillar
or a hall, we should know that what is seen is in reality only that
which appears through the eyes. It does not appear through the ears, the
nose, the tongue or the bodysense. When paññā has not been developed to
the degree of knowing the difference between the characteristics of nāma
and rūpa, this stage of insight cannot arise. 

Questioner: When I receive a Dhamma book about the
practice in daily life, I read it many times, because I want to be able
to practise. However, all the time there is a concept of self, there is
self who sees when there is seeing. I cannot realize that colour is
rūpa, seeing is nāma. I keep on thinking about all that has been
explained, but I cannot be aware of nāma and rūpa in the right way.
Please, could you explain to me how to be aware?

Sujin: When there is seeing which experiences an object
through the eyes, can you at that moment investigate the characteristic
of the dhamma that naturally appears? It is essential to know how
understanding should be developed, so that later on paññā can become
accomplished to the degree of the first stage of insight, knowledge of
the difference between nāma and rūpa. First of all, sati can be aware
and study the different characteristics of nāma and rūpa which are
naturally appearing through any doorway. Awareness is different from
thinking about nāma and rūpa, from theoretical understanding that stems
from listening to the Dhamma. Awareness of realities is not developed
when you, while seeing, think about it with agitation, worry and
nervousness. It is not developed if you think with agitation that what
appears is rūpa and that seeing is nāma. At such a moment, there is no
investigation, no study of a characteristic of rūpa or a characteristic
of nāma. It is necessary to have first correct understanding of the
characteristics of nāma and rūpa so that satipaṭṭhāna can arise and be
directly aware of them. You should understand that the nāma that sees is
a reality that experiences something, that it has no shape or form and
that it is non-self. It is not necessary to assume a particular posture
in order to know realities. It is not necessary to stand first and then
see, or to sit or lie down first and then see, so that you would know
seeing as it is. 

Satipaṭṭhāna investigates precisely the characteristic
of seeing as a type of reality that experiences something, not “I” or
self, not a being or a person. When satipaṭṭhāna arises and it is aware
of the characteristic of rūpa appearing through the eyes, that
characteristic can be investigated. In this way it can be known as only
a type of reality, not self, not a being or a person.

Questioner: The practice should be steadfast, not
agitated, as you just said. Therefore, is it possible to use the method
of satipaṭṭhāna of breathing (ānāpāna satipaṭṭhāna)? The subjects of
satipaṭṭhāna are body, feeling, citta and dhamma, but we can combine
these with ānāpāna sati, mindfulness of breathing. I myself have given
the name of “ānāpāna satipaṭṭhāna” to this way of practice. 

Sujin: It is mostly the desire for result that causes a
person to look for a combination of several methods. He may not know how
to develop understanding and tries therefore to use one method in
combination with another one so that understanding (sampajañña) would
become more accomplished. He believes that there is in that way no
forgetfulness and that he can focus for a long time on one object.
However, is that not clinging? People may well wish to focus citta for a
long time on a particular object, but they cannot be mindful in the
right way, they cannot be mindful, of what appears, for example, through
the eyes or through the other doorways. When people try to make citta
concentrate on one object they are actually combining several methods of
development because of clinging to result. It is not the development of
paññā. 

For the person who develops satipaṭṭhāna naturally, the
aim is to understand realities and thereby to become detached from them.
However, if one has no understanding yet, one cannot become detached.
Can you, while you try to make citta concentrate on one object, let go
of desire? If you try to concentrate, you do not develop paññā with the
aim of understanding realities and becoming detached. If people try to
do something other than developing satipaṭṭhāna naturally, they will not
know as they are the characteristics of realities that are appearing at
this moment. Hearing is real, it appears naturally and so it is with
thinking, happy feeling or unhappy feeling; they all appear naturally,
they are all dhammas, realities. If sati does not arise and is not aware
of realities, there is not the development of satipaṭṭhāna. What is the
use of combining different methods of practice if there is no
understanding of nāma and rūpa as they appear already through the six
doors?

Questioner: When I combine different methods, I acquire
more understanding of the three characteristics of impermanence, dukkha
and anattā. They are explained in the textbooks I have read. I also have
read about mindfulness of breathing and this helps me not to be
distracted by other matters. If I have a problem that I cannot solve, I
apply myself to mindfulness of breathing. But if I try to think, “seeing
through the eyes is nāma, it is non-self,” or, “hearing is non-self,” I
feel confused. There is still self all the time, self who is acting, who
is thinking. I feel confused and worried about that. 

Sujin: If you combine different ways of practice, you
are bound to become worried, because there is no paññā which
investigates and studies the characteristics of realities as they
naturally appear. You said that the benefit derived from your way of
practice is knowing the three general characteristics of realities:
impermanence, dukkha and anattā. However, that is only textbook
knowledge of the three characteristics. If you do not know nāma and rūpa
as they appear, how can you know the three general characteristics of
nāma and rūpa? They must be characteristics of the nāma and rūpa that
appear, one at a time.

It is through insight knowledge, vipassanā ñāṇa, that
the three general characteristics are penetrated. There cannot be
vipassanā ñāṇa if one does not know the different characteristics of the
nāmas and rūpas as they appear one at a time. If one does not know the
difference between the characteristic of nāma and the characteristic of
rūpa, the three general characteristics of realities cannot be
penetrated.

Questioner: How should one be aware? I know that sati is
aware, but how? Should there be profound consideration or a more
superficial consideration of the three general characteristics of
impermanence, dukkha and anattā? Or should there be awareness only of
softness and hardness? I have understood what you taught about the
practice, I listened for two or three years. However, I cannot practise.
I learnt about nāma and rūpa, but what are they? How should I be aware
of them? I feel confused about awareness of dhammas at the present
moment. There must be a special method for this. A special method is
important. Should there be profound awareness or awareness which is more
superficial, awareness for a long time or for a short time? But I take
everything for self. 

Sujin: This way of acting leads to confusion. You may
try to regulate sati, to have profound awareness or a more superficial
awareness, to have a great deal of it or only a little, but, as regards
the development of paññā, there is no special method or technique. The
development of paññā begins with listening to the Dhamma, and studying
the realities sati can be aware of, so that understanding can grow.
These are conditions for the arising of sati that is directly aware of
the characteristics of nāma and rūpa as they naturally appear. Since the
nāma and rūpa that appear are real, paññā can come to know their true
nature.

You should not try to regulate sati and try to make it
strong or to make it decrease so that it is weak, or to make it
superficial. If one acts in that way, one clings to the concept of self
and does not investigate and study the characteristics of the dhammas
that appear. What are the realities that appear? Someone who is not
forgetful considers realities and he can be naturally aware of their
characteristics. He begins to know very gradually the characteristics of
nāma dhammas and rūpa dhammas. He does not try to make sati focus on an
object so that it could consider that object more deeply, over and over
again. Sati arises and falls away, and then there may be again
forgetfulness, or sati may be aware again of another object. Thus, we
can see that satipaṭṭhāna is anattā. People who understand that all
realities, including satipaṭṭhāna, are anattā, will not be confused. If
someone clings to the concept of self, he is inclined to regulate and
direct sati, but he does not know the right way. If one’s practice is
not natural, it is complicated and creates confusion. If awareness is
natural, if the characteristics of realities that appear are considered
and investigated, there will be understanding, no confusion. 

Questioner: I do not know yet the characteristic of
satipaṭṭhāna. When I listen intently to your lecture, I understand the
subject matter, the theory. There is also awareness while I have
theoretical understanding, but I do not consider nāma and rūpa at this
moment. I am not sure whether that is satipaṭṭhāna or not. 

Sujin: If we do not know that our life is only nāma and
rūpa, we are bound to take realities for self. We are full of the
concept of self and this can only be eradicated completely by
satipaṭṭhāna. Sati can be aware and begin to investigate the
characteristics of nāma and rūpa that appear. In the beginning, when
sati is aware, there cannot yet be clear understanding of the realities
that appear as nāma and as rūpa. The understanding may be so weak that
it is hardly noticeable. Understanding develops only gradually, it can
eliminate ignorance stage by stage; ignorance cannot be immediately
eradicated. It is just as in the case of the knife-handle someone holds
each day and which wears off only a little at a time. 

We read in the “Kindred Sayings” (III, Middle Fifty, Ch
V, § 101, Adze-handle) that the Buddha, while he was in Sāvatthī, said
to the monks that defilements can be eradicated by realizing the arising
and falling away of the five khandhas. This cannot be achieved “by not
knowing, by not seeing.” If someone would just wish for the eradication
of defilements and he would be neglectful of the development of
understanding, defilements cannot be eradicated. Only by the development
of understanding, defilements can gradually be eliminated. We read:

“Just as if, monks, when a carpenter or carpenter’s apprentice looks
upon his adze-handle and sees thereon his thumb-mark and his
finger-marks he does not thereby know: ‘Thus and thus much of my
adze-handle has been worn away today, thus much yesterday, thus much at
other times.’ But he knows the wearing away of it just by its wearing
away. Even so, monks, the monk who dwells attentive to self-training has
not this knowledge: ‘Thus much and thus much of the āsavas has been worn
away today, thus much yesterday, and thus much at other times.’ But he
knows the wearing away of them just by their wearing away.”

 Understanding has to be developed for an endlessly long
time.[^326] Some people dislike it that sati and paññā develop
only very gradually, but there is no other way. If someone is impatient
and tries to combine different ways of practice in order to hasten the
development of paññā, he makes his life very complicated. 

Questioner: What is the difference between the practice
that is natural and the practice that is unnatural?

 Sujin: At this moment, you are sitting in a natural way
and you may be aware of realities which appear, such as softness or
hardness, presenting themselves through the bodysense, or visible object
appearing through the eyesense. All these dhammas appear naturally.
However, someone’s practice is unnatural if he believes, while he
develops satipaṭṭhāna, that he should sit cross-legged, in the lotus
position, and that he should concentrate on specific realities. There is
desire when a person selects realities that have not arisen yet as
objects of awareness. He neglects to be aware of realities that appear
already, such as seeing, hearing, visible object, sound, odour, flavour,
cold, heat, softness or hardness. Even if there is only a slight amount
of wrong understanding, it conditions clinging and this hides the truth.
In that case, paññā cannot arise and know the dhammas appearing at that
moment. 

People who develop satipaṭṭhāna should know precisely
the difference between the moment of forgetfulness, when there is no
sati, and the moment when there is sati. Otherwise, satipaṭṭhāna cannot
be developed. If one is usually forgetful, one is bound to be forgetful
again. Someone may wish to select an object in order to concentrate on
it, but this is not the way to develop satipaṭṭhāna. We should have
right understanding of the moment when there is forgetfulness, no sati,
that is, when we do not know the characteristics of realities appearing
in daily life, such as seeing or hearing. When there is sati, one can
consider, study and understand the dhammas appearing through the six
doors. When someone selects a particular object in order to focus on it,
he will not know that sati is non-self. When sati arises, it can be
aware of realities that naturally appear. When odour appears, there can
be awareness of odour that presents itself through the nose. It can be
known as only a type of reality that arises, that appears and then
disappears. Or the nāma which experiences odour can be understood as
only a type of reality that presents itself. After it has experienced
odour, it falls away. It is not a being, a person or self.

Questioner: Is it true that the sotāpanna, the person
who has attained the first stage of enlightenment, does not recognize
his father or mother?

Sujin: The sotāpanna clearly realizes the dhamma that
sees as a type of nāma. After seeing he knows what it is that was
perceived, namely a person, a being or a thing he can think of. Thinking
is another type of nāma that arises and then falls away. Is there
anybody who sees and then does not know the meaning of what was seen? If
that is the case, the Buddha would not have recognized Ānanda or
Moggallāna, or anything at all. Then there would be only the nāma that
sees and no other types of nāma that recognize what was seen. However,
dhammas take their own natural course, they are what they are. Apart
from the nāma that sees there is, after the seeing, also the nāma that
knows the meaning of what was seen.
