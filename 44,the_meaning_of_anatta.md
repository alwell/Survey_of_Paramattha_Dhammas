# The Meaning of Anattā

Questioner: There are four Applications of Mindfulness:
mindfulness of the body, of feeling, of citta and of dhammas. The
commentator[^332] compares these four subjects with four
gateways of a city, one of which faces east, one west, one north and one
south. People can go to the centre of the city by anyone of these four
gates. Many teachers today say that just as one can use anyone of the
gates to enter the city, it is sufficient to cultivate only one of the
Four Applications of Mindfulness; one does not need all four. Only
mindfulness of the body would be sufficient. Can one then in this way
reach nibbāna?

Sujin: The development of paññā is very subtle. It is
not so that anyone who reads the commentary can practise. Where is the
gate? If people do not know where the gates are, through which gate can
they enter?

Questioner: The gates are: body, feeling, citta and
dhammas.

Sujin: What do you know through the bodysense? One
should really consider all realities in detail, no matter whether they
are classified as khandhas, āyatanas,[^333] dhātus (elements) or
the noble Truths. They are not beings, people or self. Conditioned
realities appearing in daily life are either nāma, the reality that
experiences something, or rūpa, the reality that does not know anything.
We may understand this in theory, but that is not the direct realization
of the characteristic of non-self of nāma and rūpa. As far as the level
of theoretical understanding is concerned which stems from listening to
the Dhamma, one may have no doubt that rūpa is real, that the rūpa that
arises and appears through the eyes are only different colours. One may
have no doubt that sound is the rūpa which appears through the ears,
odour the rūpa which appears through the nose, flavour the rūpa which
appears through the tongue, and so on. People may have no doubt that
nāma is real, that it arises and experiences different objects; they can
have theoretical understanding of this. However, if there is no
awareness of the characteristic of nāma, how can there be paññā that
directly understands nāma as the reality which experiences an object, as
the element, the nature that knows? Can the development of only
awareness of the body be the condition to realize the characteristic of
nāma?

The person who develops paññā should be aware of the
characteristic of nāma while he is seeing. He can investigate and study
that characteristic so that it can be realized as only a kind of
experience. When there is hearing, there can be awareness of it and it
can be understood as a reality which experiences sound. When someone
develops satipaṭṭhāna he should study and investigate time and again the
characteristic of the nāma which experiences an object through one of
the six doorways, so that he can understand nāma as it really is. When
paññā realizes that there are nāmas which are not yet known, it will
also study and investigate these, and in this way the characteristic of
nāma can clearly appear as only an element which experiences, only a
reality, not a being, person or self. 

Someone may make an effort to be aware just of the
characteristic of the nāma that hears and he is not aware of the nāma
that sees. How can he then understand the true characteristic of the
element that experiences while he is seeing? People can verify for
themselves that this is not the right way of development.

Paññā can develop by awareness that considers and
studies the characteristics of the nāmas experiencing an object through
the senses and through the mind-door. If paññā clearly understands all
kinds of nāma that appear, if it understands these as the element which
experiences an object, doubt about nāma can gradually be eliminated.
Paññā can become keener and more accomplished as it develops in
successive stages. However, if someone intends to know only one kind of
nāma, it is evident that there is still ignorance and doubt with regard
to the characteristics of the other kinds of nāma he has not been aware
of. And thus, ignorance and doubt with regard to nāma as the element
which experiences cannot be eliminated.

Questioner: People gain understanding from listening to
the Dhamma. When they practise they can attain the first stage of
vipassanā ñāṇa, “defining of nāma and rūpa.” They pass that stage.

 Sujin: How do they pass that stage?

Questioner: I do not know anything about that.

Sujin: People should not become excited when they are
wondering whether others have passed a stage of insight knowledge. It is
by a person’s own understanding that he can know that paññā has been
developed to the degree of the first vipassanā ñāṇa. He knows that
insight knowledge realizes nāma and rūpa as they naturally appear, one
characteristic at a time, in a mind-door process. At the moments of
vipassanā ñāṇa, not merely one kind of nāma or one kind of rūpa has been
penetrated. 

Questioner: Someone may have practised insight unto to
the fifth stage of mahā-vipassanā ñāṇa, the “knowledge of
dispassion”(nibbidā ñāṇa). He watches the rūpa that sits, stands or
walks, and he practises until he reaches the “knowledge of dispassion.”
I have doubts about how he watches the rūpa that sits, stands or walks.
How should we practise so that we can attain that stage of vipassanā
ñāṇa?

Sujin: What is the meaning of the first stage of
insight, “defining of nāma and rūpa”? So long as one has not realized
that stage yet, one cannot attain “knowledge of dispassion.” 

There is mindfulness of the body when sati is mindful of
one characteristic at a time of rūpa paramattha, as it appears through
the bodysense. It may be a rūpa such as cold, heat, softness, hardness,
pressure or motion. Mindfulness of the body is not watching the postures
of sitting, lying, standing or walking. When, for example, cold appears,
there is only the characteristic of cold, there is no “I,” it is not
“mine,” not self. If someone does not know the characteristic of rūpa as
it appears through one doorway at a time, as only a kind of rūpa, he
cannot even attain the first stage of insight knowledge, which discerns
the difference between the characteristic of nāma and the characteristic
of rūpa. How could paññā then realize the stage of “knowledge of
dispassion,” the fifth stage of “principal insight” (mahā-vipassanā)?

Questioner: In the section of “Clear Comprehension”
(sampajañña) in the “Satipaṭṭhāna sutta,” it is explained that when we
are standing, we should know that we are standing, when walking,
sitting, bending or stretching, we should know that we are doing so. We
should know the characteristics of the different postures. When we know
that we are walking while we are walking, is that the practice with
regard to the rūpa that walks?

Sujin: If there would be no rūpa, could we walk? 

Questioner: If there would be no rūpa, there would be
only air and this cannot walk.

Sujin: When you are walking there is one characteristic
of rūpa appearing at a time and it can be known as it appears through
one doorway. 

Questioner: Is it rūpa that walks?

Sujin: The rūpa which appears, no matter whether we are
sitting, lying down, standing or walking, appears through the
sense-doors or through the mind-door. It is anattā, it appears anyway
because of the appropriate conditions; it is of no use trying to select
a particular rūpa. 

Questioner: As we have seen, in the commentary, the
Papañcasūdanī, a simile is used of the four gateways leading to the
centre of the city. A person who enters the city can enter through any
one of these four gateways. Therefore, some people select a particular
object; they develop only mindfulness of the body, not the other
applications of mindfulness.

Sujin: When someone reads the commentary he ought to
understand what paññā should know in order to eradicate wrong view,
which takes realities for self.

There are two kinds of realities: nāma and rūpa. So long
as people do not clearly know the characteristics of nāma and rūpa, they
take them for self. 

As regards the wording, “while walking, we should know
that we are walking,” in reality it is not “I” or self who is walking.
When sati is aware of the characteristics of rūpas of the body that
appear while walking, there is mindfulness of the body (kāyānupassanā
satipaṭṭhāna)[^334]. However, people cannot force sati to be
aware all the time of rūpas appearing through the bodysense. Sati is
anattā and it depends on conditions whether it will arise and be aware
of a characteristic of nāma or rūpa. It can be aware of any
characteristic of nāma or rūpa that arises and appears naturally, just
as it is. The paññā that eradicates wrong view knows clearly the
characteristics of nāma and rūpa as they appear through the six doors
and it realizes them as non-self. 

We read in the “Kindred Sayings” ( IV, Saḷāyatana vagga,
Kindred Sayings on Sense, Fourth Fifty, Ch III, § 193, Udāyin):

> “Once the venerable Ānanda and the venerable Udāyin were staying at
Kosambī in Ghosita Park. Then the venerable Udāyin, rising at eventide
from his solitude, went to visit the venerable Ānanda, and on coming to
him... after the exchange of courtesies, sat down at one side. So seated
the venerable Udāyin said to the venerable Ānanda: ‘Is it possible,
friend Ānanda, just as this body has in divers ways been defined,
explained, set forth by the Exalted One, as being without the self, is
it possible in the same way to describe the consciousness, to show it,
make it plain, set it forth, make it clear, analyze and expound it as
being also without the self?’

> ‘Just as this body has in divers ways been defined, explained, set
forth by the Exalted One, as being without the self, friend Udāyin, so
also is it possible to describe this consciousness, to show it, make it
plain, set it forth, make it clear, analyze and expound it as being also
without the self. Owing to the eye and visible object arises
seeing-consciousness, does it not, friend?’

> ‘Yes, friend.’

> ‘Well, friend, it is by this method that the Exalted One has explained,
opened up, and shown that this consciousness also is without the self.’
”

> (The same is said with regard to the other doorways).

If someone does not clearly know the reality that is
nāma, doubt has not been eliminated yet. If there is still doubt, how
can he realize the noble Truths? Through which gate will he enter? The
gateways mentioned in the commentary refer to the moments before
lokuttara citta arises and realizes nibbāna. In the process of attaining
enlightenment, mahā-kusala kāmāvacara cittas (of the sense sphere) arise
before lokuttara citta arises, and it depends on conditions which of the
four satipaṭṭhānas this kāmāvacara citta takes as object.[^335]
However, this does not mean that someone could enter the city, that is,
realizing nibbāna, without clearly knowing the characteristics of
rūpakkhandha, vedanākkhandha, saññākkhandha, saṅkhārakkhandha and
viññāṇakkhandha. 

Before someone can understand that this body is anattā
and that also this consciousness is anattā, the characteristics of nāma
and rūpa appearing at this moment must be “described, shown, made plain,
set forth, made clear, analysed and expounded”, as we read in the sutta.
Characteristics of nāma and rūpa appear at this moment, while we see,
hear, smell, taste, experience tangible object or think. 

It is not easy to be able to penetrate the meaning of
anattā, to understand the true nature of all realities, to realize them
as anattā. If Ānanda had not been a sotāpanna, he would not have known
thoroughly the realities that are nāma and rūpa. Only paññā of that
degree can eradicate wrong view that takes nāma and rūpa for self, being
or person. If Ānanda had not been a sotāpanna, he could not have said to
Udāyin that it is also possible to describe consciousness, to show it,
make it plain, set it forth, make it clear, analyse it and expound it as
being anattā. Therefore, when someone realizes the true nature of a
particular dhamma, then that dhamma will appear clearly to him. 

At this moment, realities arise and then fall away very
rapidly. If a person has not realized the true nature of realities, they
do not appear to him as they are, even if he says that, while there is
seeing or hearing, nāma is the element which experiences an object.
Whereas, when realities have appeared to him as they are, it is evident
that he clearly knows their true characteristics. 

Ānanda had no doubt about the characteristics of nāma
and rūpa, no matter through which doorway they appeared. If someone at
the present time thinks that he should develop mindfulness of only one
of the Four Applications of Mindfulness, such as mindfulness of the
body, or that he should know only one type of nāma or rūpa, could he
know the true characteristics of nāma and rūpa? If he would understand
the truth of realities, why does he not know, while he is seeing, the
nāma which experiences an object through the eyes, as the element which
sees? Why does he not know, while he is hearing, the nāma that
experiences an object through the ears, the element that hears? Why does
he not realize, while thinking, that it is only nāma which knows
concepts or words? If he would really understand what nāma is, he would
be able to understand the true nature of the element that experiences an
object.

There is a way to find out whether one knows the truth
of realities or not. When a nāma or rūpa appears through one of the six
doors and paññā can distinguish between the characteristic of nāma and
the characteristic of rūpa, their characteristics are known as they are.
Paññā should be able to discern the different characteristics of nāma
and of rūpa when there is seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting,
experiencing tangible object or thinking. In this way, the meaning of
anattā can be penetrated; the nāma and rūpa that appear can be realized
as anattā. 

When Ānanda asked Udāyin whether seeing-consciousness
arises owing to the eye and visible object, Udāyin had no doubt about
eyesense and the rūpa appearing through the eyes, while seeing at that
moment. We read further on in the Udāyin Sutta that Ānanda said:
> 
“ ‘Well, if the condition, if the cause of the arising of
seeing-consciousness should altogether, in every way, utterly come to
cease without remainder, would any seeing-consciousness be evident?’ 

> ‘Surely not, friend.’

> ‘Well, it is by this method that the Exalted One has explained, opened
up, and shown that this consciousness also is without the self.’”

If one really understands that while there is hearing,
there is no seeing, one can know the characteristics of realities as
they are. When there is thinking about different matters, there is no
seeing, no hearing. There is only the nāma that thinks at such a moment
about different subjects. In this way, the characteristics of realities
can be understood as they are. 

As Ānanda said to Udāyin, seeing arises dependent on
eyesense and visible object which appears through the eyes, but, when
eyesense and visible object which are impermanent have completely fallen
away, how could there be seeing? Seeing must have fallen away. 

If someone at this moment would clearly know the
characteristic of the reality which experiences an object, as an element
which experiences, he would have attained already the first stage of
insight knowledge, the “defining of nāma and rūpa.”[^336] One
cannot develop paññā immediately to the degree of insight that is the
fifth stage of “principal insight,” “knowledge of dispassion” (nibbidā
ñāṇa). After the first stage of insight, paññā has to be developed
further so that it can directly understand conditions for the realities
that arise. The second stage of insight is “discerning conditions for
nāma and rūpa” (paccaya-pariggaha-ñāṇa). 

Then paññā can be developed further to the degree of
realizing the arising and falling away of realities in succession. This
is the third stage of insight, “comprehension by groups” (sammasana
ñāṇa).

After that paññā should be developed to the degree of
realizing the arising and falling away of one reality at a time,
separately. This is the first stage of “principal insight”
(mahā-vipassanā), “knowledge of the arising and falling away of nāma and
rūpa” (udayabbaya ñāṇa).

After that paññā must be developed further so that it
can penetrate more the impermanence of realities that fall away all the
time. This is the second stage of principal insight, “knowledge of
dissolution” (bhaṅga ñāṇa). Then paññā must be developed still further
to the stage of seeing more clearly the danger and disadvantage of the
falling away of realities. This is the third stage of principal insight,
“knowledge of appearance as terror” (bhaya ñāṇa). After that the fourth
stage can be realized, which is “knowledge of danger” (ādīnava ñāṇa).
After that paññā, should be developed to the degree of the fifth stage
of insight, “knowledge of dispassion” (nibbidā ñāṇa). After that several
more stages of insight have to be reached before enlightenment can be
attained.

Paññā should clearly understand the characteristics of
realities. It is impossible to enter the gateway to nibbāna if the
characteristic of nāma is not known, and if only the postures of
sitting, lying down, standing or walking are

known. If someone knows which posture he has assumed, he has only
remembrance or perception of the rūpas that arise together and
constitute a “whole” of a posture. He does not realize the
characteristics of nāma and rūpa, one at a time, as they arise and
appear naturally, just as they are, through the different doorways and
then fall away. 

As we read in the Udāyin Sutta, Ānanda said to Udāyin
with reference to seeing-consciousness, that the Buddha had explained
that this is also without the self. Ānanda said to Udāyin: 

> “ ‘Owing to the eye and visible object arises seeing-consciousness, does
it not, friend?”

> “Yes, friend.” 

> “Well, friend, it is by this method that the Exalted One has explained,
opened up, and shown that this consciousness also is without the self.”


He repeated the same about the other sense-cognitions
and the consciousness that experiences objects through the mind-door. 

This sutta shows how beneficial it is that the Buddha
explained the Dhamma completely and in all details. He explained about
all types of citta, which are nāma. If someone could realize the noble
Truths by having only one kind of object of mindfulness, of what use
would it be that the Buddha explained about all the other dhammas? He
explained all about seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, the experience
of tangible object, thinking, pleasant and unpleasant feeling,
remembrance and other dhammas. He did so in order to help people to be
mindful of these realities, to consider, study and clearly comprehend
them. That is the way leading to the complete eradication of doubt and
wrong view about nāma and rūpa. 

Someone may believe that, by knowing only one type of
nāma or one type of rūpa, he can still realize the noble Truths. He
pretends to be able to realize enlightenment, but he does not understand
the characteristics of nāma and rūpa as they naturally appear, just as
they are. Then he is sure to have doubt and uncertainty about the nāma
and rūpa he believes he cannot know. It is evident that he in that way
cannot attain enlightenment. 

We read further on in the Udāyin Sutta about a simile
Ānanda used. He said to Udāyin:

> “Suppose, friend, that a man should roam about in need of heart of wood,
searching for heart of wood, looking for heart of wood, and, taking a
sharp axe, should enter a forest. There he sees a mighty plantain-trunk,
straight up, new-grown, of towering height. He cuts it down at the root.
Having cut it down at the root, he chops it off at the top. Having done
so he peels off the outer skin. But he would find no pith inside, much
less would he find heart of wood. 

Even so, friend, a monk beholds no trace of the self nor of what
pertains to the self in the sixfold sense-sphere. So beholding, he is
not attached to anything in the world. Unattached he is not troubled.
Untroubled, he is of himself utterly set free. So that he realizes,
‘Destroyed is rebirth. Lived is the righteous life. Done is the task.
For life in these conditions there is no hereafter.’ ”

We just read that Ānanda said that a man in search for
heart of wood enters a forest and sees a mighty plantain-trunk, straight
up, new-grown, of towering height. So long as it is a plantain-trunk, it
still has the appearance of a “whole.” Then we read, “Having cut it down
at the root, he chops it off at the top. Having done so, he peels off
the outer skin.” We should eliminate clinging to what we are used to
taking for a “whole”, for a “thing”, for self. 

We then read, “But he would find no pith inside, much
less would he find heart of wood.” Thus, he becomes detached from the
idea of plantain-trunk. It is the same as in the case of a cow that is
still not cut up by a cattle butcher, as we read in the Papañcasūdānī,
the commentary to the Satipaṭṭhānasutta. If the cattle butcher does not
skin it and cut it up in different parts, he is bound to see it as a
cow, he does not see it as different elements. So long as rūpas are
still seen as joined together, one perceives them as a “whole,” or as a
whole posture such as the “sitting rūpa”. People are bound to consider
realities as a thing, a self, a being or person who is there. Only if
someone knows nāma and rūpa as they are, he does not take them for
beings or people anymore. It is just as after peeling off the skin of
the plantain, any pith in it is not to be found, much less heart of
wood. As we have read, Ānanda said: “Even so, friend, a monk beholds no
trace of self nor what pertains to the self in the sixfold
sense-sphere.” 

In the sixfold sense-sphere (phassāyatana)[^337]
there is no posture. Eyesense is an internal “āyatana”, and visible
object is rūpāyatana, an external āyatana, it is only what appears
through the eyes. Someone may see a person who is sitting and cling to
the idea of “person” or “self”, although he says that there is no self.
If he has only theoretical understanding, he may not realize that the
truth of anattā can be understood only by awareness of seeing and other
realities that appear. Paññā should know that seeing only sees what
appears through the eyes. After having seen visible object, one thinks
of and remembers the shape and form of what appears and knows what it
is. Also at that moment there is a type of nāma that knows and remembers
something, it is not a being, person or self who does so. When hearing
arises which experiences sound through the ears, no remembrance remains
of what was experienced through the eye-door, no remembrance of a
perception of people sitting and talking to each other. When hearing
presents itself, sati can be aware of the reality that hears, an element
which experiences only sound. After that, citta thinks of words or
concepts, on account of different sounds, low and high, which have been
heard. Paññā can know, when words are understood, that only a type of
nāma understands the meaning of words. 

If different types of realities are known, one
characteristic at a time, as nāma and rūpa, the wrong view that takes
realities for self is eliminated. One will let go of the idea of
realities as a “whole” or a posture. Then it can be understood what it
means to have inward peace, because citta does not become involved in
outward matters, such as self, people or beings. There is no longer the
world one used to cling to, the world outside, which is full of people
and different things. There is no longer what one used to take for a
particular person, for a thing, for self, all permanent and lasting.
Whenever sati arises paññā can at that moment understand realities
clearly, and then there is inward peace, because there are no people,
beings or things. Whereas, when there are many people, many concepts in
one’s life, there is no peace. If someone sees a person he is acquainted
with or he has a particular relation with, he thinks, as soon as he has
seen him even for a moment, a long “story” about him. If he sees a
person he does not know, the “story” is short; he thinks only for a
little while about him and then the “story” is over. He does not
continue to think about him. 

As a person develops paññā, he acquires more
understanding of the excellent qualities of the Buddha and of the Dhamma
he taught in all details. One can appreciate the teachings also at the
level of restraint or “guarding” of the senses (saṃvara sīla) as
contained in the Pāṭimokkha, the Disciplinary code for the monks. This
is the conduct through body and speech befitting the “samana,” the
person who is a monk, who leads a peaceful life. We read in the
“Visuddhimagga” (I, 50) about the restraint of the monk with regard to
seeing:

> “What is proper resort as guarding? Here ‘A bhikkhu, having entered
inside a house, having gone into a street, goes with downcast eyes,
seeing the length of a plough yoke, restrained, not looking at an
elephant, not looking at a horse, a carriage, a pedestrian, a woman, a
man, not looking up, not looking down, not staring this way and that.’
This is called proper resort as guarding.”

This was said to remind us not to continue the “story”
after the seeing and dwell on it for a long time, thinking in various
ways of this or that person or matter. When we have seen, we should know
that it is only seeing. No matter
whether one looks no further than the length of a plough yoke ahead or
not, there is seeing and then it is gone. In that way, one will not be
absorbed in the outward appearance and details. Paññā can clearly
understand that it is just because of thinking that we are used to
seeing the outward world that is full of people. If we do not think,
there is only seeing and then it is gone. Can there be many people at
that moment? However, one is used to thinking for a long time, and thus
one is bound to think time and again of many different subjects.

In what way someone thinks, depends on the conditions
that have been accumulated. People may see the same thing, but each
individual thinks differently. When people see, for example, a flower,
one person may like it and think it beautiful, whereas someone else may
dislike it. It all depends on the individual’s thinking. Each person
lives with his own thoughts, and thus, the world is in reality the world
of thinking. When sati is aware of nāma and rūpa, it will be clearly
known that it is only a type of nāma that thinks of different subjects.
If the characteristic of the nāma that thinks is clearly known, it can
be understood that someone’s conception of people and beings is not
real. When someone is sad and he worries, he should know that there is
sadness just because of his thinking. It is the same in the case of
happiness, it all occurs because of thinking. When someone sees on T.V.
a story he likes, pleasant feeling arises because he thinks of the
projected image he looks at. Thus, people live only in the world of
thinking, no matter where they are.

The world of each moment is nāma that arises and
experiences an object through one of the sense-doors and through the
mind-door, and after that citta continues to think of different stories.

Questioner: You just said that happiness and sadness are
only a matter of thinking. I do not understand this yet. Who likes to
think of something that makes him unhappy? Nobody likes to be unhappy.
In what way does a person think so that he is unhappy?

Sujin: It is not so that a person thinks in order to be
unhappy. There are conditions for the arising of unhappiness due to the
thinking.

Questioner: Does this mean that there are conditions for
sadness when someone, for example, has to part with his possessions or
when he has lost a horse-bet? He returns home and thinks of the
horse-bet he has lost. Then the horse-bet may be a condition for his
unhappiness.

Sujin: If he would not think about the horse which has
lost the race, could there be sorrow about it?

Questioner: No, there would not. 

Sujin: When there is seeing or hearing and after that
thinking, paññā should know that thinking is only a type of nāma which
thinks about different subjects and then falls away. When someone thinks
about a horse, there is no horse at that moment. There is remembrance of
an idea or concept of a horse and this causes the arising of
unhappiness. Thus, unhappiness arises because a person thinks about
something he does not like, and happiness arises because he thinks about
something he likes.

The Dhamma we study, the whole Tipiṭaka, together with
the commentaries and sub-commentaries, have been taught so that paññā
can arise and understand the realities that are naturally appearing at
this moment, just as they are. People may have listened and studied
much, they may have had many Dhamma discussions and pondered over the
Dhamma very often, but all their learning should lead to accumulating
conditions, that are all good qualities included in saṅkhārakkhandha,
for the arising of right awareness. Then sati can be aware, study and
consider the characteristics of the realities appearing at this moment
through the sense-doors and the mind-door. People may have heard this
time and again, but they need to be reminded to investigate the dhammas
that are real, one at a time. If sati is aware, there will be right
understanding of dhammas and eventually they will be realized as anattā.
Day in day out there are only nāma and rūpa, arising and falling away
each moment. When they have fallen away, there is nothing left of them,
they do not last even for a moment. 

We should know that our enjoyment or sorrow that arose
in the past have fallen away, that they are completely gone. Now there
is just the present moment and it is only at this moment that we can
study realities and understand them as not self, not a being or a
person. Some people say that they do not wish to meet a particular
person again in a next life. If they would have right understanding of
the Dhamma, they would not have such thoughts. In a next life, there
will not be this or that person one meets at the present, nor will there
be “I”. After death, the existence of someone as this particular person
in this life has definitely come to an end. Only in this life there is
this person and in a next life he is another person. Therefore, one
should not worry nor have anxiety about meeting a particular person
again. This is impossible, since the existence as this or that person
does not continue on to the next life.

If someone has irritation or annoyance about another
person, he should understand that in reality there is not that person.
There are only dhammas, citta, cetasika and rūpa, which arise and then
fall away. Life, in the ultimate sense, lasts only as long as one single
moment of citta. 

If we reflect time and again on death, it can support
the development of satipaṭṭhāna. If we consider that we may die this
afternoon or tomorrow, it can be a supporting condition for sati to be
aware of the characteristics of nāma and rūpa that appear. For those who
have not realized the noble Truths, thus, for those who are not ariyans,
it is not certain whether, after the dying-consciousness has fallen
away, the rebirth-consciousness will arise in a happy plane or in an
unhappy plane of existence. It is not certain whether there will be
again an opportunity to listen to the Dhamma and to develop
satipaṭṭhāna.

At death, a person parts with everything in this life,
it is all over. There is nothing left, not even remembrance. When a
person is born into this life, he does not remember who he was, where he
lived and what he did in his former life. His existence as a particular
person in a former life has come to an end. Even so, in this life,
everything comes to an end. A person performs kusala kamma and akusala
kamma, he may have conceit about his race, family, possessions, honour
and fame, all this comes to an end. There will be no ties left with all
the things in this life. All that we find so important in this life, all
that we are holding on to and take for self, will come to an end. If
people realize the true characteristics of paramattha dhammas that arise
because of their own conditions, they will eliminate the inclination to
take them for beings, people or self. 

Even remembrance that arises and falls away is only a
type of nāma. If sati is aware of nāma and rūpa and paññā understands
them clearly, one can let go of the wrong view of a self or person who
exists in this life. Then one has realized the characteristic of
“momentary death” (khaṇika maraṇa) of realities, their passing away at
each moment. There are three kinds of death:[^338]

- momentary death, khaṇika maraṇa, which is the arising and falling
 away of all conditioned dhammas; 
- conventional death, sammuti maraṇa, which is dying at the end of a
 lifespan; 
- final death, samuccheda maraṇa,[^339] which is
 parinibbāna, the final passing away of the arahat who does not have
 to be reborn.
