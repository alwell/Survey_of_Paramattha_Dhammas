the adverting-consciousness and the receiving-consciousness, and that
mind-consciousness-element includes all cittas other than those included
in mind-element and the sense-cognitions.

[^8]: See “The Expositor”, “Atthasālinī”, Introductory
Discourse, 26. The teachings as compiled (not yet written) literature
are thus enumerated in the scriptures as nine divisions, for example in
the “Middle Length Sayings” I, no. 22.

[^9]: The Pāli term sutta means that which is heard. The word
of the Buddha which has been heard.

[^10]: The three Piṭaka, or Tipiṭaka, are the three divisions
of the teachings, namely: the Vinaya, Suttanta and Abhidhamma. When the
teachings are classified as nine divisions, the Vinaya is in a section
of the Sutta. The “Atthasālinī” mentions the “Sutta-Vibhaṅga” and
“Parivāra” in the section on Sutta, which belong to the Vinaya.

[^11]: In the “Atthasālinī”, the counting is one hundred and
twelve.

[^12]: The PTS has edited and translated the entire Vinaya
Piṭaka as “The Book of the Discipline”: “Suttavibhaṅga” comprising
“Mahāvibhaṅga” and “Bhikkhunīvibhaṅga” (Vol. I-III), “Mahā-vagga” (Vol.
IV), “Cullavagga” (Vol.V) and “Parivāra” (Vol.VI).

(two volumes), the “Itivuttaka” commentary (two volumes), the commentary
to the “Vimānavatthu”, “Vimāna Stories,” the commentary to the
“Petavatthu”, “Peta Stories,” the commentary to the “Therīgāthā”,

another one by T.W. Rhys Davids.

[^35]: One edition as translated by Ven. Nyāṇamoli, Colombo,
and one edition as translated by Pe Maung Tin, P.T.S.

[^36]: It has been translated into English and published by
the P.T.S. under the title of “Compendium of Philosophy”, and by Ven.
Nārada, Colombo, under the title of “A Manual of Abhidhamma”. It has
also been translated by the Venerable Bhikkhu Bodhi as “A Comprehensive
Manual of Abhidhamma”. Moreover, it has been translated together with
its commentary as “Summary of the Topics of Abhidhamma” and “Exposition
of the Topics of Abhidhamma”, by R.P. Wijeratne and Rupert Gethin.

[^37]: The P.T.S. edition suggests that the date is between
the 8th and the 12th century A.D.

[^38]: Translated into English by by R.P. Wijeratne and
Rupert Gethin, see footnote 29.

[^39]: I could add to this enumeration the “Nettippakaraṇa”,
translated as “The Guide,” P.T.S. and the “Peṭakopadesa” which has been
translated as “Piṭaka Disclosure” by Ven. Ñāṇamoli. They are
compilations of a school, which, according to tradition, traced its
descent to Mahā-Kaccana, one of the great disciples of the Buddha.
Dhammapāla has written a commentary on the “Nettippakaraṇa”, probably
late fifth century A.D.

Buddha.

[^42]: There are eight types of lokuttara cittas
(supramundane consciousness), which realize the lokuttara dhamma that is
nibbāna. There are four stages of enlightenment and for each of those
there are two types of lokuttara citta, path-consciousness and
fruition-consciousness. This will be explained later on.

[^43]: Brahmacariya, the life of those who develop
satipaṭṭhāna, right understanding of realities, in order to become an
arahat.

[^44]: Universal Buddha, who found the Path all by himself
and could teach the truth to others.

[^45]: “Abhidhammattha-vibhāvinī-ṭīkā”.

[^46]: Satta is being and upakāra is assistance.

[^47]: The magga-citta is the lokuttara citta, supramundane
citta, experiencing nibbāna and eradicating defilements. It is
accompanied by wisdom, paññā, which is called magga-ñāṇa.

[^48]: These powers are his perfect comprehension in the
field of wisdom, such as comprehension of deeds (kamma) which bring
their appropriate results, comprehension of the elements, the khandhas
(mental and physical phenomena), the āyatanas (sense-fields),
comprehension of the inclinations of other beings, remembrance of his
former lives, knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of other beings,
the destruction of defilements. (“Middle Length Sayings” I, no. 12, The
Greater Discourse on the Lion’s Roar).

[^49]: Even arahats, those who have no defilements, can have
behaviour which is not pleasing, such as speaking fast or running,
accumulated in the past. Such conduct is not motivated by akusala citta,
unwholesome consciousness, since they have eradicated all defilements.

[^50]: See “Dialogues of the Buddha” III, no. 30, The Marks
of the Superman.

[^51]: “Puggala Paññatti”, “Designation of Human Types,” Ch
I, Division of Human Types by One, 28, 29. Pacceka is derived from the
Pāli paṭi eka, by himself. Eka means alone.

[^52]: He tried to kill the Buddha on various occasions.

[^53]: Dhamma has several meanings, it does not only mean
doctrine. In this context dhamma means everything which is real,
reality.

[^54]: “Dialogues of the Buddha” II, no. 16, Mahā Parinibbāna
Sutta, Ch V, 144.

[^55]: This will be explained later on.

[^56]: The Pāli term paramattha is derived from parama,
superior, highest, and attha, which is “meaning.” Paramattha dhammas are
realities in the highest or ultimate sense.

[^57]: Abhidhamma, the third part of the Tipiṭaka, means
“higher Dhamma,” Dhamma in detail. It deals with ultimate or absolute
realities, different from conventional truth. Ultimate reality or
paramattha dhamma can also be called “abhidhamma”.

[^58]: Cakkhu means eye, and pasāda means clearness or
sense-faculty. The cakkhu pasāda rūpa is able to receive the impingement
of colour.

[^60]: Sati is the cetasika that is mindfulness. Its function
will be explained later on.

[^61]: “Dhammasangaṇi”, “Buddhist Psychological Ethics”, Book
II, Material Form, Ch I, §595.

[^62]: Rūpas can be produced by one of the four factors that
are kamma, citta, temperature or nutrition.

[^63]: All rūpas other than the four principle rūpas are
derived rūpas, upādāya rūpas, because the latter cannot arise without
the four principle rūpas.

[^64]: Sabhāva rūpa is a rūpa with its own distinct nature.
Sa in Pāli means with, and bhāva means nature. There are also asabhāva
rūpas, which, though classified among the 28 kinds of rūpa, are not
separate rūpas with their own nature, but special qualities connected
with other rūpas. They will be explained later on.

[^65]: Lakkhaṇa means characteristic.

[^66]: Upacaya means heaping up.

[^67]: Santati means continuity.

[^68]: “A” in Pāli means “not”. Asabhāva, without a distinct
nature.

[^69]: Vikāra means change or alteration.

[^70]: “Minor Anthologies”, “As it was said,” the Twos, Ch 2,
VII. Vāna means weaving or craving. Ni is a particle meaning negation.
Another etymology: vā is blowing. Nibbāna is blowing out, extinction.

[^71]: The five khandhas are rūpakkhandha (rūpa),
vedanākkhandha (feeling), saññākkhandha (remembrance or perception),
saṅkhārakkhandha, including all cetasikas except feeling and saññā, and
viññāṇakkhandha, including all cittas.

[^72]: So long as there are defilements there are conditions
for rebirth. When all defilements have been eradicated, there is the end
of the cycle of birth and death, and then the khandhas do not arise
again.

[^73]: “Minor Anthologies”, “As it was said,” the Twos, Ch 2,
VII, and its commentary.

[^74]: Sa means with, upādi means substratum of life, the
khandhas, and sesa means remaining. “A” (becoming “an” before a vocal)
indicates a negation.

[^75]: “As it was said” and commentary.

[^76]: “Dialogues of the Buddha” II, no. 16, Mahā Parinibbāna

[^77]: Vimokkha means liberation, emancipation.

[^78]: Dhammas that arise and fall away are not happiness,
they are not worth clinging to, they are dukkha. The person who has
realized dukkha when he is about to attain nibbāna becomes emancipated
by desirelessness.

[^79]: Dhammas are void of the self.

[^82]: Saṅkhāra is derived from saṅkharoti, to combine, put
together or compose.

[^83]: Saṅkhata is the past passive participle of saṅkharoti: 
what has been put together, has been composed.

Saṅkhāra dhamma and saṅkhata dhamma refer to the same realities, but
these different terms have been used to explain more clearly the nature
of conditioned dhammas. Saṅkhāra dhamma refers to dhamma which depends
on other dhammas which condition its arising, whereas saṅkhata dhamma
refers to dhamma which has been conditioned to arise and then falls
away.

[^93]: The Pāli term lujjati, to be broken up, has been
associated in meaning with “loko,” the world. See for example “Kindred
Sayings” IV, Second Fifty, Ch 3, §89.

[^94]: Uttara means higher, beyond. Lokuttara is beyond the
world. The cittas that experience nibbāna when enlightenment is attained
are lokuttara cittas. This will be explained further on.

[^97]: A group of defilements.

[^98]: Pronounced: “chitta.”

[^99]: Citta is accompanied by cetasikas, mental factors,
which also experience the object, but citta is the leader in cognizing
the object.

[^100]: The same synonyms have been given in “Mahā-Niddesa”,
Pasūra Sutta, No. 319.

[^101]: Mindfulness of Body, of Feeling, of Citta and of
Dhammas.

[^102]: We find the same text in the commentary to the “Path
of Discrimination”, the “Saddhammappakāsinī”, regarding the ‘Treatise on
Breathing’, section 4, “What are the thirty-two kinds of knowledge in
mindful workers,” stating that each citta, even akusala citta, can be
called paṇḍaram. As to the bhavanga-citta that is called “luminous”,
phabassaraṃ, the “Atthasālinī” refers to the “Gradual Sayings”
I,10: "Bhikkhus, the mind is luminous (pabhassara), but it is corrupted
by adventitious corruptions.” The bhavanga-citta which is vipākacitta is
not involved in outward objects and hence akusala cetasikas do not
accompany it. Here it is obvious that the citta is luminous and pure.
But also when it is accompanied by defilements, the citta itself is
different from the defilements, its nature is pure, pandaraṃ. The
“Atthasālinī”, in the same section, states: "Though immoral, it is
called 'clear' (pandaraṃ) because it issues [^from subconscious vital
functions]: just as a tributary of the Ganges is like the Ganges and a
tributary of the Godhāvarī is like the Godhāvarī." Even when citta is
accompanied by defilements, it does not lose its natural purity, just as
the water of a tributary is like the water of the main river. Citta just
clearly knows an object.

[^103]: Cittas that experience objects through the six doors
arise in processes, and each citta in that process performs its own
function. This will be explained later on.

[^104]: Sati, mindfulness, is a cetasika that is
non-forgetful of what is wholesome. There are different levels of sati.
Sati of satipaṭṭhāna is non-forgetful, mindful of the characteristics of
nāma and rūpa.

[^105]: There are six rūpas that are vatthu. The five senses
are vatthus for the sense-cognitions and the heart-base is vatthu for
all the other cittas. Vatthu is not identical with āyatana, which
comprises both nāma and rūpa.

[^106]: Saha means together and jāta means arisen.

[^107]: Citta is one of the four factors that produce rūpas
of the body. The other factors are kamma, temperature and nutrition.
Citta produces groups of rūpas, consisting of the eight inseparable
rūpas, and groups which have in addition other types of rūpa.

[^108]: Mundane, lokiya, is not lokuttara, supramundane.
Lokuttara cittas experience nibbāna. Cittas other than lokuttara cittas
are mundane. This will be explained in Ch 23.

[^109]: The arahat has mahā-kiriyacittas instead of
mahā-kusala cittas.

[^110]: In this context the Pāli term cita derived from
cinati is used, which means heaped up, accumulated.

[^111]: Kusala, akusala, vipāka, result, and kiriya, neither
cause nor result. This will be explained further on.

[^112]: The different Pāli terms used here are word
associations with the word citta and they represent the different
aspects of citta.

[^113]: In a process of cittas there are seven javana cittas
which are, in the case of non-arahats, kusala cittas or akusala cittas.
This will be explained later on.

[^114]: As will be explained, in a process of cittas there
are, in the case of non-arahats, usually seven javana cittas which are
kusala cittas or akusala cittas, arising and falling away in succession.

[^115]: The arahat does not perform kamma that can produce
result. He has reached the end of rebirth. He has no kusala cittas or
akusala cittas.

[^116]: That bhavanga-citta does not experience the rūpa
which impinges on the sense-base, but it is affected or stirred by it,
since within an infinitesimally short time vīthi-cittas will arise.

[^117]: Akusala citta and kusala citta arise and fall away,
but the inclinations to akusala and kusala are accumulated; the
accumulated inclinations are the condition for the arising again, later
on, of akusala citta and kusala citta.

[^118]: In Pāli, pañca means five, dvāra means door and
āvajjana means adverting.

[^119]: The five sense-doors are rūpas, whereas the
mind-door is nāma.

[^120]: Javana, which means “impulse,” is also translated in
some texts as “apperception.”

[^121]: One may perform wholesome deeds without the
development of the Eightfold Path, without right understanding of nāma
and rūpa. Then there will be no eradication of defilements, no end to
the cycle of birth and death.

[^122]: This is the opposite of ācayagāmin, accumulation.

[^123]: This is the case when the process does not run its
full course, as will be explained later on.

[^124]: Each citta is anantara-paccaya, the condition for
the arising of the next citta.

[^125]: See Chapter 2.

[^126]: Of each pair, one citta is kusala vipākacitta and
one citta is akusala vipākacitta.

[^127]: As will be explained later on, they experience the
object, which was experienced by the last javana-cittas of the previous
life.

[^128]: This is the case when the sense-door process has run
its full course with two tadālambana-cittas.

[^129]: There are five rūpas, which are pasāda rūpas, the
sense organs that can receive the impingement of the relevant sense
objects.

[^130]: The bhavangupaccheda is bhavanga-citta, not
vīthi-citta. It does not experience the object, which is experienced by
the cittas of the mind-door process. Since it precedes the mind-door
adverting-consciousness, it is merely the doorway, the means through
which the vīthi-cittas of the mind-door process can experience the
object.

[^131]: Kiriya or kriyā is derived from karoti, to do. It
means action or occupation. Kiriyacitta performs a function. It is
translated as “functional,” or it is translated as “inoperative,”
because it does not produce any result. It is neither kusala nor akusala
and it is not vipāka.

[^132]: See Chapter 11.

[^133]: This means prepossession or obsession.

[^134]: This means transgression.

[^135]: See Chapter 10.

[^136]: In the “Dhammasaṇgani” (Book III, Ch I, Group of
Triplets, 1025-1027) dhammas are classified as low, medium and exalted.
The “Atthasālinī” (I, Book I, Part I, 45,) explains that “mean” is
applied to akusala dhammas, that medium, existing midway between low and
exalted, is applied to the remaining dhammas of the three planes of
citta (of the sense sphere, rūpa-jhānacittas, arūpa-jhānacittas), and
“exalted” to the lokuttara dhammas.

[^137]: The cetasikas chanda, wish-to-do, viriya, effort, or
vīmaṃsā, investigation of the Dhamma, can be accompanying predominant
factors and these can be of a lesser degree, medium or superior (see
“Visuddhimagga”, I, 33). Moreover, citta accompanied by at least two
roots can be a predominant factor.

[^138]: The three abstinences are abstention from wrong
speech, wrong action and wrong livelihood. Abstention from wrong
livelihood is abstention from wrong speech and wrong action pertaining
to one’s livelihood.

[^139]: See Chapter 7.

[^140]: Rūpa does not last longer than seventeen moments of
citta. Rūpa originated by kamma cannot survive after death.

[^141]: The results of kusala cittas of the four stages of
arūpa-jhāna, immaterial jhāna. These arise in planes where there is no
rūpa.

[^142]: Rūpa, in this case temperature, is too weak at its
arising moment; it can only produce another rūpa at the moment of its
presence.

[^143]: These will be specified further on in this chapter.

[^144]: There are five stages of rūpa jhāna, fine material
jhāna, and thus, there are five types of vipākacittas that are results.
There are four stages of arūpa jhāna and thus, there are four types of
vipākacittas that are results.

[^145]: There are eight types of citta rooted in lobha,
attachment, two types rooted in dosa, aversion, and two types rooted in
ignorance.

[^146]: Smile-producing consciousness.

[^147]: Four are accompanied by pleasant feeling, four by
indifferent feeling; four are associated with wisdom, four are without
wisdom; four are not induced and four are induced. The kāmāvacara
kiriyacittas are classified in the same way. See Appendix I to Citta.

[^148]: Investigating-consciousness, santīraṇa-citta,
performs the function of investigating in a sense-door process, but this
type of citta can also perform the function of rebirth-consciousness. In
the latter case, it is still called investigating-consciousness since it
is the same type of citta as that arising in a sense-door process.

[^149]: There are 8 types of mahā-vipākacitta, which are
results of the eight types of mahā-kusala citta; they are accompanied by
pleasant feeling or indifferent feeling, accompanied by wisdom or
unaccompanied by wisdom, arising without being induced, or being
induced. These details will be explained further on.

[^150]: Only in the planes where there are sense impressions
there are, after the javana-cittas, conditions for kamma to produce
vipākacittas which “hang on” to the object experienced during that
process.

[^151]: It performs the function of adverting in the
mind-door process and it performs the function of determining,
votthapana, in the sense-door process.

[^152]: This type of citta can only perform the function of
investigation in a sense-door process when the object is very pleasant.
It can also perform the function of retention or registering.

[^153]: In this connection, there is a word association
between citta and cito, which means accumulated.

[^154]: Kusala kamma and akusala kamma condition the
revolving in the cycle of birth and death. They condition birth in a new
existence; they condition seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and the
experience of tangible object. These experiences (vipāka) are the
condition again for the cycle of defilements.

[^155]: Puññā is merit, kusala. Abhisaṅkhāra stands for
cetanā, volition or intention. Although at the moment of kusala citta
there is no ignorance with the citta, ignorance can still condition
kusala kamma. So long as ignorance has not been eradicated, one has to
continue in the cycle of birth and death, performing both good deeds and
evil deeds that bring results. Only the arahat who has eradicated
ignorance is freed from the cycle. He does not perform kusala kamma nor
akusala kamma, deeds that bring results.

[^156]: Apuññā is demerit, akusala.

[^157]: The teachings can be explained according to the
Suttanta method or the Abhidhamma method. The Buddha preached the Suttas
to people with different accumulations and he used conventional terms so
that they could understand his teaching more easily. The explanation
according to the Abhidhamma method is by way of paramattha dhammas,
ultimate realities.

[^158]: These factors will be explained further on.

[^159]: Upadhi means foundation or substratum.

[^160]: One may, with confidence in kusala, perform good
deeds. At another moment one may, with attachment, take delight in one’s
own good deed and take one’s attachment for confidence. Or, one may take
attachment to a teacher for confidence that is wholesome.

[^161]: The seventh Book of the Abhidhamma, the “Paṭṭhāna,”
deals with all the conditions for the phenomena that arise.

[^162]: The Sutta about the “Unthinkables” is quoted further
on in this chapter.

[^163]: The other three are “Mindfulness of the Body”,
“Mindfulness of Feeling,” “Mindfulness of Dhammas.”

[^164]: See also “Gradual Sayings,” II, Book of the Fours,
Third Fifty, Ch XIV, §3.

[^165]: Pada means “word” of the text and parama means
highest.

[^166]: In combination with other wholesome qualities
comprised in saṅkhārakkhandha, the khandha of formations or activities.

[^167]: Sobhana cetasikas are wholesome qualities, which can
accompany cittas of three jātis. Further on, the term sobhana will be
explained more in detail.

[^168]: Avyākata means undeclared. They are not “declared”
as kusala or akusala.

[^169]: Avacara means moving in or frequenting.

[^170]: Included are 12 akusala cittas, 8 kusala cittas, 8
mahā-vipākacittas, 8 mahā-kiriyacittas (of the arahat). Also included
are the ahetuka vipākacittas that are the ten sense-cognitions (two
pairs), 2 receiving-consciousnesses and 3 investigating-consciousnesses,
the ahetuka kiriyacittas that are the sense-door
adverting-consciousness, the mind-door adverting-consciousness and the
smile-producing-consciousness of the arahat.

[^171]: For each of the five stages of rūpa-jhāna there are
rūpāvacara kusala citta, vipākacitta and kiriyacitta.

[^172]: For each of the four stages of arūpa-jhāna there are
arūpāvacara kusala citta, vipākacitta and kiriyacitta.

[^173]: For each of the four stages of enlightenment there
are the path-consciousness, magga-citta, and its result, the
fruition-consciousness, phala-citta.

[^174]: Birth in these planes is the result of rūpa-jhāna.

[^175]: Birth in these planes is the result of arūpa-jhāna.

[^176]: Rebirth in a rūpa-brahma plane is the result of
rūpa-jhāna and rebirth in an arūpa-brahma plane is the result of
arūpa-jhāna.

[^177]: Nibbāna and the lokuttara cittas that experience it
cannot be objects of clinging.

[^178]: The hell planes, the animal world, the plane of
petas (ghosts) and the plane of asuras (demons).

[^179]: See “Visuddhimagga”, VII, 42-44 and footnote 15. A
circle of world-sphere mountains encloses the ocean. In the centre of
the ocean is Mount Sineru or Mount Meru. The Southern continent of
Jambudīpa, Rose-Apple Land, is the known inhabited world. Sometimes
Jambudīpa refers to India.

[^180]: See “Visuddhimagga” VII, 40, footnote 14.

[^181]: See Jātakas VI, no. 545.

[^182]: See the Second Book of the Abhidhamma, the “Book of
Analysis,” Ch 18, 6, Age limit.

[^183]: For some individuals rūpa-jhāna is of four stages,
and for some it is of five stages. Jhāna factors are successively
abandoned as higher stages of jhāna are reached. For those who have
abandoned the two factors of applied thinking and sustained thinking at
the second stage there are only four stages of jhāna. For those who have
abandoned only the factor of applied thinking and not the factor of
sustained thinking at the second stage, there are five stages of jhāna.

[^184]: They have seen the disadvantages of nāma and this is
the condition for them to be reborn without nāma.

[^185]: Mahā means great and gata means gone or reached.

[^186]: Those who are skilled in jhāna can have jhānacittas
in succession for a long period of time. That is why jhānacitta is
called sublime because of its duration. During the attainment of jhāna
there is no bodily suffering. The jhānacitta is sublime because of its
fruition; it can cause rebirth in rūpa-brahma planes and arūpa-brahma
planes.

[^187]: The magga-citta does not lead to rebirth; it
eradicates defilements, the conditions for rebirth.

[^188]: Sahagata means accompanied.

[^189]: Feeling can also be classified as threefold: 
pleasant feeling, unpleasant feeling and indifferent feeling. It can be
classified by way of contact through the six doorways, and by other
ways.

[^190]: One type is not induced and one type is induced.
This will be explained later on.

[^191]: This will be explained further on.

[^192]: Uddhacca accompanies each akusala citta, but the
second type of moha-mūla-citta is called uddhacca-sampayutta and in this
way it is differentiated from the first type.

[^193]: There are seven javana-cittas in a process, which
are kusala cittas or akusala cittas in the case of the non-arahat.

[^194]: The arūpa-jhānacittas are accompanied by the same
jhāna factors as the fifth rūpa-jhānacitta. This will be explained
further in the section on Samatha.

[^195]: Mahā means great. Mahā-kusala cittas are kusala
cittas of the sense sphere, kāmāvacara kusala cittas. Mahā-kiriyacittas
and mahā-vipākacittas are also cittas of the sense sphere, accompanied
by beautiful roots, sobhana hetus.

[^196]: Alobha is non-attachment, adosa is non-hate or
kindness, amoha is paññā.

[^197]: As we have seen, the arahat does not perform kamma
which can produce result, and thus, kiriyacittas perform the function of
javana.

[^198]: Kusala vipākacitta can be accompanied by sobhana
hetus or it can be ahetuka, without hetus.

[^199]: “Sa” means with.

[^200]: Material food, contact, cetanā and viññāṇa can be
āhāra-paccaya. In the case of āhāra-paccaya, the conditioning dhamma
maintains the existence of and supports the growth of the conditioned
dhamma. See Appendix to Cetasika, under phassa.

[^201]: This will be explained further in the Appendix.

[^202]: Añña means other and samāna means common. When
kusala citta is taken into account, akusala citta is taken as “other,”
and vice versa.

[^203]: This will be explained further in the Appendix.

[^204]: The Commentary to the “Abhidhammattha Sangaha”: “The
body, being the support of feeling, represents the vessel; feeling,
being the thing enjoyed, represents the food; recognition (saññā), being
the means by which one savours the feeling, represents the seasoning;
formations, as putting things together, represents the cook;
consciousness, being the one who enjoys (it all), represents the one who
eats”.

[^205]: See also “Visuddhimagga” VII, 80, 81.

[^206]: The rebirth-consciousness, the bhavanga-cittas and
the dying-consciousness are, in one lifespan, the same type of
vipākacitta, result of the same kamma.

[^207]: The stages of insight will be explained further on
in this book.

[^208]: Not translated into English, but this text is
similar to “Kindred Sayings” III, Khandhāvagga, First Fifty, §33.

[^209]: I used the translation of Ven. Bodhi, in “the
Connected Discourses of the Buddha”.

[^210]: See for these terms Ch 4, Exposition of Paramattha
Dhammas II.

[^211]: The last bhavanga-citta before vīthi-cittas arise
and the stream of bhavanga-cittas is arrested.

[^212]: By impingement of visible object on the eyesense.

[^213]: The others are: mindfulness of body, of feeling and
of dhammas.

[^214]: “Show-piece” is a translation of the Pāli: 
citta-caraṇa, citta which is called caraṇa, travelling. The Commentary
to this passage adds that the artists went about, that they were
travelling, exhibiting their work of art.

[^215]: Being born as an animal is the result of kamma.
Citta is the source of good and bad actions which are performed and
which will bring different results.

[^216]: The Evil One. The word Māra has several meanings; it
can also represent defilements and all that is dukkha.

[^217]: Paramattha dhammas: usually translated as ultimate,
absolute, or fundamental realities.

[^218]: Citta, cetasika, and rūpa: Citta is a moment of
consciousness which cognizes an object; seeing, for example cognizes
colour. There is one citta at a time and it is accompanied by several
cetasikas, mental factors, each performing its own function. Rūpa
(physical phenomenon, materiality, matter), does not know anything.

[^219]: Nāma: mental phenomena, that is, citta and cetasika.
Rūpa: physical phenomena.

[^220]: The element of earth denotes solidity appearing as
hardness or softness. It can be experienced through touch.

[^221]: “Abhidhammattha Sangaha”: an encyclopaedia of
Abhidhamma, ascribed to Anuruddha and composed sometime between the 8th
and 12th centuries A.D. It has been translated into English and
published by the P.T.S. under the title of “Compendium of Philosophy”,
by Ven. Nārada, Colombo, under the title of “A Manual of Abhidhamma”,
and by Bhikkhu Bodhi as “A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma”.
Moreover, it has been translated together with its commentary as
“Summary of the Topics of Abhidhamma” and “Exposition of the Topics of
Abhidhamma”, by R.P. Wijeratne and Rupert Gethin.

[^222]: The Fully Enlightened One, an epithet for the
Buddha.

[^223]: The Five Khandhas (aggregates) are rūpa
(materiality), vedanā (feeling), saññā (perception, memory), saṅkhāra
(all other mental factors) and viññāna (citta or consciousness).

[^224]: The twelve āyatanas (bases) are eye-base, visible
object-base, ear-base, sound-base, nose-base, odour-base, tongue-base,
flavour-base, body-base, tangible-data-base (includes hardness,
softness, heat, etc.), mind-base, dhammāyatana. Mind-base, manāyatana,
includes all cittas. Dhammāyatana includes cteasikas, subtle rūpas and
nibbāna, which are experienced through the mind-door.

[^225]: The eighteen dhātus (elements) include three for
each sense-door. For the eye-door these are: eye element, visible object
element, seeing consciousness element. The other five doors are ear,
nose tongue, body and mind. (See “Visuddhimagga” XV,17)

[^226]: Vedanā and saññā are cetasikas that accompany each
citta.

[^227]: Akusala citta can be rooted in greed, delusion, or
aversion. Kusala citta, citta that is wholesome or skilful.

[^228]: Abhiññās are supernatural powers.

[^229]: Cittas experiencing objects that impinge on the six
doors arise in a process of cittas; they are vīthi-cittas. Visible
object is not only experienced by seeing-consciousness, but also by
other cittas arising within a process. See appendix.

[^230]: Bhavanga-cittas are translated as life continuum.
Bhavanga-cittas arise in between the processes of cittas. They do not
experience the objects that impinge on the five sense-doors and the
mind-door. They experience the same object as the rebirth-consciousness,
the first citta in life. See appendix.

[^231]: There are 28 kinds of rūpas. Twelve are gross and
sixteen are subtle. The gross rūpas are the five sense organs and the
sense objects that can be experienced through eyes, ears, nose, and
tongue, and three rūpas that can be experienced through the bodysense,
namely, solidity, temperature, and motion. Subtle rūpas include, for
example, cohesion and nutritive essence

[^232]: Javana literally means “running through,” impulsion;
the javana-cittas arise in the sense-door processes and in the mind-door
process, and they “run through the object.” There are usually seven
javana-cittas in a process of cittas, and these are kusala or akusala in
the case of non-arahats. Arahats do not have kusala cittas or akusala
cittas; they have kiriyacittas.

[^233]: Tadālambana is also called tadārammaṇa. See
Appendix.

[^234]: There are numerous defilements (unwholesome mental
factors), such as lobha, greed, attachment, aversion, ignorance and
wrong view.

[^235]: The six classes are the five sense organs, the
sixteen subtle rūpas, citta, cetasika, nibbāna, and concept.

[^236]: Unwholesome cittas, akusala cittas, are cittas
rooted in unwholesome roots, akusala hetus. They are lobha-mūla-cittas,
dosa-mūla-cittas (cittas rooted in aversion or hate) or
moha-mūla-cittas, cittas rooted in ignorance.

[^237]: The four noble Truths are dukkha (suffering), the
origin of dukkha, the cessation of dukkha, and the way leading to the
cessation of dukkha.

[^238]: Indriya (faculties): see “Visuddhimagga” XVI, 1.

[^239]: See “Dhammasaṅgaṇī” (translated as Buddhist
Psychological Ethics by P.T.S.) §1306.

[^240]: Softness and hardness are tangible objects, rūpas,
which can be experienced through the bodysense.

[^241]: See Appendix.

[^242]: Rūpas that fall away are immediately replaced by new
rūpas so long as there are conditions for them. Rūpas of the body are
produced by four factors: kamma, citta, temperature and nutrition.

[^243]: Lobha-mūla-cittas can be accompanied by wrong view
or they can be without wrong view. When they are accompanied by wrong
view there is clinging to a distorted view of reality.

[^244]: The sobhana cetasikas, beautiful cetasikas, which
are the factors of the Eightfold Path are: right understanding, right
thinking, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort,
right mindfulness and right concentration. The development of the
Eightfold Path is actually the development of right understanding of
nāma and rūpa that appear at the present moment.

[^245]: This is the khandha or aggregate that includes all
cetasikas except vedanā, feeling, and saññā, remembrance or perception.
Paññā and all sobhana cetasikas are included in saṅkhārakkhanda and
together they can become the accumulated condition for the growth of
paññā, eventually leading to enlightenment.

[^246]: The four Great Elements of earth, water, fire and
wind are conventional terms that refer to characteristics of rūpa such
as solidity, cohesion, temperature and motion or pressure.

[^247]: Rūpas do not arise singly; they arise in groups,
each of which consists of at least eight rūpas.

[^248]: The arahat is fully enlightened; he has extinguished
all defilements. The sotāpanna (first stage of enlightenment) has
uprooted wrong view but still has other defilements. The sakadāgāmī and
anāgāmī are at the second and third stage of enlightenment,
respectively. All four are called ariyan, noble.

[^249]: In Pāli, there is a word association of yana,
carriage, and ñāṇa, wisdom.

[^250]: Sampajaññā is often translated as clear
comprehension. In this context, the person who develops samatha should
not merely have theoretical knowledge of the difference between
lobha-mūla-citta and mahā-kusala citta, but he should be able to
distinguish between their characteristics when they appear.

[^251]: Abhabba puggala, a person who is unable of progress.
He is not born with rebirth-consciousness accompanied by paññā, or he
has committed ānantariya kamma, very serious akusala kamma that produces
an immediate result at rebirth, or he has the kinds of wrong view which
are of the degree of akusala kamma patha.

[^252]: He is a bhabba puggala, a person who is able to make
progress. See “Gradual Sayings”, Book of the Sixes, Ch IX, § 2 and 3.

[^253]: See Appendix to Citta, under akusala citta.

[^254]: A kasina is a concrete device, such as a disc of
earth or a coloured disc, which can condition calmness. If one looks at
it with right concentration one can acquire a mental image of it. Kasiṇa
means whole, entire. If the earth kasina is one’s meditation subject,
all things can be seen as just “earth,” and it is the same in the case
of the other kasinas. The image conceived in this way can be extended
without limitation.

[^255]: Earth is one of the Four Great Elements present with
all materiality.

[^256]: For details, see “Visuddhimagga” IV, 21-31.

[^257]: The jhāna-factors are specific cetasikas developed
in samatha. These will be dealt with further on.

[^258]: World Ruler.

[^259]: See “Visuddhimagga” IV, 34-42.

[^260]: See “Visuddhimagga” IV, 42-67.

[^261]: There are five indriyas, spiritual faculties, which
should be developed, namely, confidence, energy, mindfulness,
concentration and understanding.

[^262]: If one is not born with paññā, one cannot attain
jhāna. If one is tihetuka, born with paññā, all bhavanga-cittas are
accompanied by paññā.

[^263]: Ākāsa means space, ananta means: infinite, and
āyatana means: sphere.

[^264]: This term includes the words viññāṇa and ananta,
meaning: consciousness which is infinite.

[^265]: Ākiñcañña means: there is nothing.

[^266]: See “Atthasālinī” I, Book I, Part VI. 207-209. There
is a subtle residuum not only of saññā but also of the citta and the
other accompanying dhammas.

[^267]: Extension of the sign means that the mental image
can be extended until it is boundless.

[^268]: See “Kindred Sayings” I, Ch VIII, The Vangīsa
Suttas, §7, Invitation.

[^269]: Vītikkama means transgression and kilesa means
defilement.

[^270]: Pariyuṭṭhāna is derived from pariyuṭṭhāti, to arise,
to pervade.

[^271]: Vikkhambhana means suppression, and pahāna means
giving up, elimination.

[^272]: Anusayati means to lie dormant.

[^273]: Samuccheda means extirpation.

[^274]: The Sangha is the order of monks, and the ariyan
Sangha are all those who have attained enlightenment, be they monks or
lay followers.

[^275]: Anupassanā means consideration, contemplation. It is
derived from passati, to see, to understand.

[^276]: Nāma and rūpa, which are included in the fourth
application of mindfulness, are classified under different aspects, such
as the “hindrances,” the five khandhas, the āyatanas.

[^277]: An ariyan who practises this is fit to instruct
others (M III, 221).

[^278]: Iddhi means power or success and pāda is foot or
step. The iddhi-pādas in vipassanā are a basis for reaching
enlightenment. They are among the thirty-seven factors pertaining to
enlightenment, bodhipakkhiya dhammas.

[^279]: See the “Dispeller of Delusion”, “Sammohavinodanī”,
commentary to the Book of Analysis, in the section on Iddhi-pādas (II,
Ch 9).

[^280]: In the classification of these thirty-seven dhammas,
the same cetasikas occur several times, but they have been classified
under different aspects and with different intensities. This shows how
many qualities have to be developed so that there are conditions for the
attainment of enlightenment.

[^281]: The person who attains enlightenment was born with a
paṭisandhi-citta accompanied by paññā, and thus all bhavanga-cittas are
of the same type, vipākacitta which is ñāṇa-sampayutta.

[^282]: It transcends the sense sphere so that the plane of
lokuttara citta can be reached.

[^283]: For those who have developed samatha and vipassanā.
See Appendix to Citta.

[^284]: See the section on Samatha.

[^285]: Thus, altogether there are seven javana-cittas.

[^286]: See “Visuddhimagga” Ch XVIII. Pariccheda is derived
from paricchindati, to mark out, limit or define.

[^287]: See “Visuddhimagga” Ch XIX. Pariggaha is derived
from parigaṇhāti, to examine, take possession of or comprehend.

[^288]: Pariññā means comprehension, or full understanding.
There are three kinds of pariññā and these will be explained further on.

[^289]: See “Visuddhimagga” Ch XX, 6 and following.
Sammasana is derived from sammasati, to grasp, to know thoroughly.

[^290]: Bala means power.

[^291]: Vipassanā ñāṇa arises in a mind-door process.

[^292]: Micchā-vimutti.

[^293]: See “Visuddhimagga” Ch XXI, for this stage and the
following stages, which are mahā-vipassanā ñāṇa, principal insight.
Udaya is rise and baya is fall.

[^294]: There are three pariññās: full understanding of the
known, ñāta pariññā, full understanding of investigation, tīraṇa
pariññā, and full understanding of abandoning, pahāna pariññā. When a
stage of insight has been reached, the knowledge gained at such moments
should be applied. The three pariññās are degrees of paññā that applies
insight knowledge by considering again and again nāma and rūpa. This
will be explained more further on.

[^295]: Bhaṅga means dissolution or breaking up.

[^296]: Muccati means to become free and kamyatā means wish.

[^297]: Paṭisaṅkhāna means discrimination.

[^298]: In Pāli: vuṭṭhāna gaminī paññā. Vuṭṭhāna means
rising up and gaminī means going.

[^299]: The “Visuddhimagga” (XXI, 130) states that anuloma
ñāṇa conforms to what precedes and to what follows. It conforms to the
eight preceding kinds of insight knowledge and to the thirty-seven
enlightenment factors that partake of enlightenment which will follow.

[^300]: The third citta is anuloma, adaptation, but all
three cittas preceding gotrabhū are adaptation knowledge.

[^301]: A person who is slow is called in Pāli: manda
puggala, and a person who is keen is called: tikkha puggala.

[^302]: The preceding javana-citta conditions the succeeding
one by way of repetition-condition.

[^303]: It does not perform the function of adverting,
āvajjana, such as is performed by the first citta arising in a
sense-door process or in the mind-door process.

[^304]: Kāla means moment, and “a” denotes a negation. See
“Visuddhimagga”, Ch VII, 80, under Recollection of the Dhamma. The
Dhamma is sandiṭṭhiko, visible here and now, and akāliko, without delay.

[^305]: Kaṅkhā means doubt and vitaraṇa means overcoming.

[^306]: There is knowledge and vision in conformity with the
truth, in Pāli: yathābhūta ñāṇa dassana. Yathābhūta means: as it really
is; ñāṇa means knowledge and dassana means seeing or vision.

[^307]: See “Visuddhimagga” Ch XXII. Amagga means: not the
path,“a” being a negation.

[^308]: Brightness, emanating from one’s body, Vis. XXII,
107, footnote 34. The “Visuddhimagga” states that this imperfection
usually arises in someone who has developed calm and insight.

[^309]: The “Visuddhimagga” Ch XXI, 2, explains why the
Knowledge of arising and falling away of realities should be pursued
again. The person who develops insight could not realize clearly the
three general characteristics of realities so long as he was disabled by
the imperfections. When the imperfections have been overcome, he should
pursue the Knowledge of arising and falling away of realities again in
order to realize the three characteristics more clearly.

[^310]: See “Visuddhimagga” Ch XXI.

[^311]: See “Visuddhimagga” Ch XXII.

[^312]: Ñāta means what has been known and pariññā means
full understanding.

[^313]: Tīraṇa means judgement, investigation.

[^314]: Pahāna means abandoning.

[^315]: The first stage of mahā-vipassanā ñāṇa.

[^316]: Sukkha vipassanā, mere insight, is also translated
as “dry insight.”

[^317]: See the section on Samatha.

[^318]: Instead of eight lokuttara cittas, magga-citta and
phala-citta of the four stages of enlighten-ment, there are forty
lokuttara cittas: five times eight lokuttara cittas when taking into
account the factors of the five stages of jhāna.

[^319]: Samāpajjati means to enter upon.

[^320]: In Pāli: jhāna-lābhī. Lābha means gain or
acquisition, and lābhī means the person who acquires something.

[^321]: See the section on Samatha. At this stage, there are
still citta and cetasikas, but they are very subtle, they are present in
a residual way.

[^322]: Both the power of samatha and the power of vipassanā
are necessary. The sotāpanna and the sakadāgāmī, even if they have
attained the highest stage of arūpa-jhāna, do not have the same degree
of paññā as the anāgāmī and the arahat; thus, in their case paññā is not
powerful enough to be able to condition cessation.

[^323]: As we have seen, the person who will attain
cessation has to attain all stages of rūpa-jhāna and arūpa-jhāna. In the
arūpa-brahma planes there are no conditions for rūpa-jhāna. Birth in
those planes is the result of arūpa-jhāna.

[^324]: Sati guards the six doors and can prevent the
commitment of akusala through body or speech.

[^325]: Sometimes citta stands for concentration.

[^326]: The “Cariyāpiṭaka”, the “Basket of Conduct” deals
with the perfections the Buddha had to develop as a Bodhisatta, for a
hundred thousand aeons and four incalculable ages. The commentary, the
“Paramatthadīpanī”, states in the “Niddesa,” the explanation at the
beginning, that among the requisites of enlightenment is “the
development for a long time,” cira kāla bhāvanā. It adds, “the
development time and again, for a long time.”



[^327]: Seven rebirths.

[^328]: Paṭigha means anger or collision. Sappaṭigha is with
impact.

[^329]: See “Visuddhimagga” Ch XIV, 74.

[^330]: To eliminate them.

[^331]: He wants to practise what is beneficial.

[^332]: See the Commentary to the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, Middle
Length Sayings no. 10, the Papañcasūdanī, in “The Way of Mindfulness” by
Soma Thera, B.P.S. Kandy, Sri Lanka.

[^333]: The internal āyatanas are the five senses and
mind-base, including all cittas, and the external āyatanas are the sense
objects and dhammāyatana which includes: cetasikas, subtle rūpas and
nibbāna.

[^334]: Anupassanā means consideration or contemplation.

[^335]: It can experience only one object at a time and it
realizes that object as impermanent, dukkha or non-self.

[^336]: Then paññā knows precisely nāma as being different
from rūpa, paññā knows nāma as nāma.

[^337]: Phassa is contact. There is contact due to the
external āyatanas and the internal āyatanas.

[^338]: “Dispeller of Delusion,” Commentary to the Book of
Analysis, Classification of the Truths, 101.

[^339]: Samuccheda means destruction.

[^340]: Sādhāraṇa means common or general. The cetasikas
that are common to all akusala cittas.

[^341]: Natthi means: there is not.

[^342]: As taught by Ajita Kesakambali (“Dialogues of the
Buddha” I, no 2, Fruits of the Life of a Recluse, § 55). He taught that
after death there is no next life but annihilation.

[^343]: Ahetuka means: without cause. Makkhali Gosāla taught
that there is no condition or cause for the corruption and purity of
beings, that everything is predestined by fate (D. I, no 2, § 53).

[^344]: As taught by Pūraṇa Kassapa (D. I, no. 2, § 53.)
Kamma literally means action, it is derived from karoti, to do.

[^345]: Pañca means five, dvāra means door and āvajjana
means adverting.

[^346]: Mano means mind.

[^347]: It is the same type as the mind-door
adverting-consciousness, accompanied by the same cetasikas, but its
function is different.

[^348]: As explained by the “Expositor” I, Book I, Part IV,
Ch VIII, 157.

[^349]: Sahita means accompanied by. Paṭhama means first.
The jhāna factors are explained in the section on Samatha in this book.

[^350]: See “Visuddhimagga” XXIII, 27.

[^351]: Akāsa means: space, ananta means: infinite, and
āyatana means: place of origin.

[^352]: Viññāṇa ananta, which means consciousness is
infinite.

[^353]: Ākiñcañña means: state of having nothing.

[^354]: Saññā means perception and āsaññā means
non-perception. The ‘n’ stands for ‘na’, which means ‘not’.

[^355]: Pañcama means fifth.

[^356]: See the section on Development of Vipassanā.

[^357]: Lābha means gain, acquisition.

[^358]: This means: accompanied by the jhāna factors of the
different stages of jhāna. The object of the lokuttara jhānacitta is not
a meditation subject but nibbāna.

[^359]: Añña means ‘other’ and samāna means ‘common’. When
kusala citta is taken into account, akusala citta is taken as other, and
vice versa.

[^360]: Sabbacitta means ‘all cittas’, and sādhāraṇa means
‘common’, ‘general’.

[^361]: Pakiṇṇaka means ‘miscellaneous’.

[^362]: There are four kinds of āhāra-paccaya: edible food,
contact, volition and viññāṇa, in this case the rebirth-consciousness.
Volition is kamma that produces rebirth, it is “food” for rebirth.
Viññāṇa, rebirth-consciousness, sustains the cetasikas and the rūpa
arising at rebirth.

[^363]: Saha means together, and sahajāta means born at the
same time.

[^364]: Thus, it is different from akusala kamma and kusala
kamma that bring their results later on. One usually thinks of kamma as
a good or bad deed, but the reality of kamma is actually cetanā
cetasika. Cetanā is not only akusala or kusala, but it is also vipāka
and kiriya. Cetanā that is vipāka or kiriya merely coordinates the tasks
of the citta and cetasikas it accompanies, and thus it is conascent
kamma-condition. Cetanā that is akusala or kusala has a double task: it
coordinates the tasks of the accompanying nāma dhammas and it “wills” or
intends akusala or kusala.

[^365]: Nānā is different and khaṇa means time. It produces
result later on.

[^366]: Some nāmas and rūpas are indriya, which means
controlling faculty or leader. Indriyas are “leaders,” each in their own
field. The rūpas that are sense organs are indriyas, they control the
relevant sense-cognitions. Citta is an indriya, manindriya, it is the
leader in cognizing an object. Nāmas such as feeling or paññā are
indriyas, leaders, each in their own field.

[^367]: These jhānacittas are: kusala jhānacitta, vipāka
jhānacitta, kiriya jhānacitta of the first stage, and eight lokuttara
jhānacittas that are accompanied by the factors of the first stage of
jhāna.

[^368]: The function of vitakka is not the same as what is
meant by thinking in conventional sense. Vitakka touches or strikes the
object, it leads citta to the object.

[^369]: He is called “learner,” sekha, because he still must
train himself and practise, so that all defilements can be eradicated.
The arahat is a non-learner, asekha.

[^370]: Cātu means four.

[^371]: Ti means three.

[^372]: Duka means pair, dyad.

[^373]: This will be explained further on.

[^374]: The two illimitables, which do not arise with every
sobhana citta, are compassion, karuṇā, and sympathetic joy, muditā.
There are four illimitables or sublime states in all. The other two are
loving-kindness, mettā, which is adosa cetasika, and equanimity,
upekkhā, which is tatramajjhattatā cetasika, and these two cetasikas are
classified among the sobhana cetasikas common to all sobhana cittas. As
will be explained later on, the four illimitables can be developed in
samatha as the subjects of calm that are the brahma-vihāras, divine
abidings. They are called illimitables or boundless states, because when
jhāna has been attained, they can be extended to an illimitable number
of beings.

[^375]: Upekkhā can stand not only for tatramajjhattatā
cetasika but also for indifferent feeling, upekkhā vedanā, for paññā
cetasika or for viriya cetasika, and this depends on the context. See
“Visuddhimagga” IV, 156-166, where the different aspects of equanimity
have been explained.

[^376]: The other three are mettā, loving-kindness, karuṇā,
compassion and muditā, sympathetic joy.

[^377]: Body stands here for the “mental body,” the
cetasikas.

[^378]: They are opposed to the hindrances such as sensuous
desire and hate.

[^379]: Ja means arisen, derived from janati, to produce.
Kammaja means originated from or produced by kamma.

[^380]: Asañña, literally, without perception or memory;
satta means being.

[^381]: In each group of rūpas there are the four Great
Elements of Earth (solidity), Water (cohesion), Fire (temperature) and
Wind (motion or pressure), and in addition the rūpas of colour, odour,
flavour and nutritive essence. These are the eight inseparable rūpas.

[^382]: Dasaka means decad.

[^383]: Navaka means nonad.

[^384]: Each moment of citta can be divided into three
infinitesimally short moments: the moment of arising, of presence and of
falling away.

[^385]: Rūpa lasts as long as seventeen moments of citta.

[^386]: Living beings can be born in four different ways: 
there are egg-born beings, womb-born beings, moisture-born beings and
beings who have a spontaneous birth.

[^387]: Suddha means pure, and attha means eight.

[^388]: Speech intimation is an asabhāva rūpa, a rūpa
without a distinct nature or characteristic. A certain change in the
rūpas produced by citta conditions the impact between the sound base and
the element of solidity produced by citta.

[^389]: Temperature, utu, and nutrition, āhāra, can produce
other rūpas only at the moments of their presence, not at their arising
moment. Rūpa is too weak at its arising moment to produce another rūpa.
Compared with the duration of citta, rūpa lasts 17 moments of citta.
After its arising moment, it exists 15 more moments, and then there is
the moment of its falling away.

[^390]: Kabala means morsel.

[^391]: Thus, not at the moment of its arising, since it is
then weak. It must have arisen already and then it can produce other
rūpas.

[^392]: Sabhāva rūpa is rūpa with its own distinct nature
and characteristic.

[^393]: There are 7 sense objects, because through the
bodysense the 3 objects of solidity, temperature and motion can be
experienced. Visaya means object.

[^394]: Sa, meaning: with, and paṭigha, meaning: 
impingement.

[^395]: Gocara means field, object and gāhika means taker.
