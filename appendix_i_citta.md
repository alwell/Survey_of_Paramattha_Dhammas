Cittas can be classified as 89 or 121 types.

89 types of citta:

    40 types



Kamāvacara cittas are cittas of the lowest level, and
they usually arise and fall away in daily life, each moment, no matter
whether we are asleep or awake. The sense objects, which are rūpa
paramattha dhamma, are experienced by kāmāvacara cittas. Among the
twenty-eight rūpa paramattha dhammas, seven kinds of rūpas appear as
objects in daily life through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue,
the bodysense and the mind-door. These rūpas, which are the objects
citta usually experiences, are called in Pāli: gocara visaya rūpas.
Gocara means pasture and visaya means sphere, object. The gocara visaya
rūpas are:

- visible object or colour, rūpārammaṇa or vaṇṇa, which appears when
 it impinges on the eyesense; 
- sound, saddārammaṇa, which appears when it impinges on the
 earsense; 
- odour, gandhārammaṇa, which appears when it impinges on the
 smelling-sense; 
- flavour, rasārammaṇa, which appears when it impinges on the
 tasting-sense; 
- tangible objects, phoṭṭhabbārammaṇa, the three rūpas of
 earth-element (softness or hardness), heat-element (cold or heat)
 and wind-element (pressure or motion), which appear when they
 impinge on the bodysense. 

The cittas that arise and fall away all the time in
daily life are usually of the level of kāmāvacara cittas. They are
engaged in the seven kinds of sense objects; they experience these rūpas
through the appropriate doorways or they think about them.



54 Types of Kāmāvacara Cittas:
- akusala cittas: 
12 types
- ahetuka (rootless) cittas:  
     18 types
- kāma-sobhana cittas (beautiful
cittas of the sense sphere):     
  24 types

12 Types of Akusala Cittas:

Akusala citta is the citta that is not wholesome, not
beautiful, because it is accompanied by akusala cetasikas. The twelve
types of akusala cittas are:

- lobha-mūla-cittas (cittas rooted in attachment):    
8 types
- dosa-mūla-cittas (cittas rooted in aversion): 
2 types
- moha-mūla-cittas (cittas rooted in ignorance):    
2 types



Mūla means root. There are three cetasikas which are the
cause or origin of akusala dhammas: lobha cetasika (attachment), dosa
cetasika (aversion) and moha cetasika (ignorance). These three cetasikas
are roots, mūla or hetu. 

Lobha-mūla-citta: the citta accompanied by lobha
cetasika, which is the condition for delight in and clinging to the
object that appears. Lobha-mūla-cittas are classified as eight types:

1. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wrong view, unprompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ).
 This type is accompanied by pleasant feeling, a feeling of
 happiness, and it is associated with the cetasika diṭṭhi, wrong view
 about realities. It is unprompted, asaṅkhārika, which means that it
 has strength, it arises without being dependent on inducement. 

2. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wrong view, prompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ).
 This type is accompanied by pleasant feeling and it is associated
 with wrong view. It is prompted, sasaṅkhārika, which means that it
 is weak, it arises by being dependent on inducement. 

3. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wrong view, unprompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-vippayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ).
 This type is accompanied by pleasant feeling and it is without wrong
 view; it is not accompanied by diṭṭhi cetasika. It has strength, it
 arises without being dependent on inducement. 

4. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wrong view, prompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-vippayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ).
 This type is accompanied by pleasant feeling and it is without wrong
 view. It is weak, it arises by being dependent on inducement. 

5. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wrong view, unprompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). This
 type is accompanied by indifferent feeling, feeling which is neither
 pleasant nor unpleasant. It is associated with wrong view. It has
 strength, it arises without being dependent on inducement. 

6. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wrong view, prompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ).
 This type is accompanied by indifferent feeling. It is associated
 with wrong view. It is weak, it arises by being dependent on
 inducement. 

7. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wrong view, unprompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-vippayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). This
 type is accompanied by indifferent feeling. It is without wrong
 view. It has strength, it arises without being dependent on
 inducement. 

8. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wrong view, prompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-vippayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ).
 This type is accompanied by indifferent feeling. It is without wrong
 view. It is weak, it arises by being dependent on inducement. 



Dosa-mūla-citta: the citta accompanied by dosa cetasika,
the dhamma that is coarse and harsh, which dislikes the object it
experiences. There are two types of dosa-mūla-citta:

1. Accompanied by unpleasant feeling, with anger, unprompted
 (domanassa-sahagataṃ, paṭigha-sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). This
 type, which is accompanied by unhappy feeling, arises together with
 paṭigha, dosa cetasika, the dhamma that is coarse and harsh. It has
 strength, it arises without being dependent on inducement. 

2. Accompanied by unpleasant feeling, with anger, prompted
 (domanassa-sahagataṃ, paṭigha-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). This
 type is different from the first type in as far as it is weak: it
 arises by being dependent on inducement. 



Moha-mūla-citta: the citta accompanied by moha cetasika,
the dhamma that is deluded, which does not know the truth of realities.
There are two types of moha-mūla-citta:

1. Arising with indifferent feeling, accompanied by doubt
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, vicikicchā-sampayuttaṃ). Moha-mūla-citta arises
 together with indifferent feeling and this type is accompanied by
 doubt, vicikicchā cetasika, which is doubt about the truth of
 realities. 

2. Arising with indifferent feeling, accompanied by restlessness
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, uddhacca-sampayuttaṃ). This type, which arises
 also with indifferent feeling, is accompanied by restlessness or
 agitation (uddhacca cetasika). 



Each citta is accompanied by several types of cetasikas.
Cittas are accompanied by a different number of cetasikas depending on
the type of citta concerned. Each citta is accompanied by feeling,
vedanā cetasika, which is different depending on the type of citta. 

Each type of akusala citta is accompanied by four
akusala cetasikas (akusala sādhāraṇa[^340] cetasikas) which are:
moha cetasika; shamelessness, ahirika cetasika, which has no shame of
evil; lack of moral dread, anottappa cetasika, which does not fear the
danger of akusala; restlessness or agitation, uddhacca cetasika, which
is involved with akusala dhammas. 

The twelve akusala cittas can be differentiated with
regard to their roots (mūla, the three akusala hetus of lobha, dosa and
moha), and then they are classified as follows:

- moha-mūla-citta, which is not accompanied by lobha cetasika nor by
 dosa cetasika, 
- dosa-mūla-citta, which is not accompanied by lobha cetasika, 
- lobha-mūla-citta, which is not accompanied by dosa cetasika. 



The twelve akusala cittas can be differentiated with
regard to three accompanying feelings, namely, indifferent feeling,
pleasant feeling and unpleasant feeling:

- Indifferent feeling, upekkhā vedanā cetasika, accompanies
 lobha-mūla-citta and moha-mūla-citta. It does not accompany
 dosa-mūla-citta. 
- Pleasant feeling, somanassa vedanā cetasika, accompanies
 lobha-mūla-citta. It does not accompany dosa-mūla-citta and
 moha-mūla-citta. 
- Unpleasant feeling, domanassa vedanā cetasika, only accompanies
 the two types of dosa-mūla-citta. It does not accompany any other
 type of citta. 



With regard to the second type of moha-mūla-citta, which
arises with indifferent feeling and is accompanied by restlessness
(upekkhā-sahagataṃ, uddhacca-sampayuttaṃ), this type is not accompanied
by doubt (vicikicchā), but it is akusala citta since it is accompanied
by akusala cetasikas. When there is akusala citta that is not one of the
eight types of lobha-mūla-citta, one of the two types of dosa-mūla-citta
or moha-mūla-citta accompanied by doubt, it is moha-mūla-citta
accompanied by restlessness. 

When akusala citta is strong, there is a condition for
the accompanying cetanā (volition or intention) to commit one of the ten
evil courses of action, kamma-patha. The ten akusala kamma-pathas are
the following:

- Three kinds of bodily action (kāyakamma): the killing of living
 beings (pāṇātipāto), stealing, which is taking what has not been
 given (adinnādānaṃ), and sexual misconduct (kāmesu micchācāro). 
- Four kinds of verbal action (vacīkamma): lying (musāvādo), rough
 speech (pharusavācā), slandering (pisuṇavācā) and idle talk
 (samphappalāpo).
- Three kinds of mental action (manokamma): covetousness or planning
 to take away someone else’s property (abhijjhā), ill will or wishing
 to hurt or harm someone else (vyāpādo) and wrong view
 (micchādiṭṭhi). Not every kind of wrong view is akusala kamma-patha.
 Wrong view that is akusala kamma-patha are the three following
 views: 

1. Natthika[^341] diṭṭhi, denial of the result of kamma; any
 result that arises does not originate from kamma.[^342] 
2. Ahetuka diṭṭhi, denial of both kamma and result. Kamma does not
 produce result, whatever arises has no condition, no
 cause.[^343] 
3. Akiriya diṭṭhi, denial of the efficacy of kamma. Kamma, action, is
 merely a behaviour by way of the body; there are no good and bad
 actions that produce results.[^344]


When the akusala citta that motivates akusala
kamma-patha has fallen away, the cetanā cetasika (volition), which arose
and fell away together with the akusala citta, is kamma-condition,
kamma-paccaya, for the arising of akusala vipākacitta. There are seven
types of akusala vipākacittas which are the results of kamma and which
arise when it is the appropriate time. 

18 Types of Ahetuka Cittas:

Ahetuka cittas are not accompanied by cetasikas that are
roots, hetus. There are six hetus: three are akusala and three are
sobhana. The three akusala hetus are the cetasikas of lobha, dosa and
moha. These arise, as the case demands, with twelve akusala cittas, they
do not accompany other types of citta. The three sobhana hetus are the
cetasikas of alobha, adosa and amoha or paññā. The citta that is
accompanied by sobhana hetus is sobhana citta, the citta that is
beautiful or wholesome. 

Eighteen types of cittas are not accompanied by these
six hetus. They are ahetuka cittas and also asobhana cittas. The other
seventy-one cittas, out of the eighty-nine cittas, are accompanied by
hetus, they are sahetuka cittas (“sa” means: “with”). 

Among the eighteen ahetuka cittas, seven types are
akusala vipākacittas, eight types are ahetuka kusala vipākacittas and
three types are ahetuka kiriyacittas. These ahetuka cittas are
classified as follows:



7 Types of Akusala Vipākacittas:

Among these are the five sense-cognitions that are
akusala vipākacittas, experiencing each their relevant object that is
unpleasant. They are:

- seeing, experiencing colour, accompanied by indifferent feeling
 (upekkhā sahagataṃ cakkhuviññāṇaṃ); 
- hearing, experiencing sound, accompanied by indifferent feeling
 (upekkhā sahagataṃ sotaviññānaṃ); 
- smelling, experiencing odour, accompanied by indifferent feeling
 (upekkhā sahagataṃ ghāṇaviññāṇaṃ); 
- tasting, experiencing flavour, accompanied by indifferent feeling
 (upekkhā sahagataṃ jivhāviññāṇaṃ); 
- body-consciousness, experiencing tangible object, accompanied by
 painful feeling (dukkha sahagataṃ kāyaviññānaṃ). 



Furthermore there are: 

- receiving-consciousness accompanied by indifferent feeling
 (upekkhā sahagataṃ sampaṭicchanaṃ); 
- investigating-consciousness accompanied by indifferent feeling
 (upekkhā sahagataṃ santīraṇaṃ). 



The receiving-consciousness which is akusala vipākacitta
arises after each of the five sense-cognitions that are akusala
vipākacittas and it receives the relevant object. The
investigating-consciousness that arises after the
receiving-consciousness is akusala vipākacitta and it considers that
object.

All these akusala vipākacittas are the results of
akusala kamma and they experience an unpleasant object (aniṭṭhārammaṇa).



8 Types of Ahetuka Kusala Vipākacittas:

These types of cittas are the results of eight types of
kāmāvacara kusala cittas accompanied by cetanā (volition) that
accomplishes one of the ten meritorious deeds (puñña kiriya vatthu).
These are included in generosity, dāna, morality, sīla, and mental
development, bhāvanā. When kusala cetanā has arisen and accomplishes
kusala kamma, kusala cetanā is kamma-paccaya, kamma-condition, for the
arising of result later on. The result can be sixteen types of
kāmāvacara kusala vipākacittas, namely: eight types of kāmāvacara
sahetuka kusala vipākacittas (with roots) and eight types of ahetuka
kusala vipākacittas (without roots).

 Among the eight types of ahetuka kusala vipākacittas
are the five sense-cognitions that are kusala vipākacittas, experiencing
each their relevant object, and this object is pleasant (iṭṭhārammaṇa).
They are:

- seeing, experiencing colour, accompanied by indifferent feeling
 (upekkhā sahagataṃ cakkhuviññāṇaṃ); 
- hearing, experiencing sound, accompanied by indifferent feeling
 (upekkhā sahagataṃ sotaviññānaṃ); 
- smelling, experiencing odour, accompanied by indifferent feeling
 (upekkhā sahagataṃ ghāṇaviññāṇaṃ); 
- tasting, experiencing flavour, accompanied by indifferent feeling
 (upekkhā sahagataṃ jivhāviññāṇaṃ); 
- body-consciousness, experiencing tangible object, accompanied by
 pleasant bodily feeling (sukha sahagataṃ kāyaviññānaṃ). 

Furthermore there are:

- receiving-consciousness accompanied by indifferent feeling
 (upekkhā sahagataṃ sampaṭicchanaṃ); 
- investigating-consciousness accompanied by indifferent feeling
 (upekkhā sahagataṃ santīraṇaṃ); 
- investigating-consciousness accompanied by pleasant feeling
 (somanassa sahagataṃ santīraṇaṃ). 



The receiving-consciousness arises after each of the
five sense-cognitions that are kusala vipākacittas and it receives the
relevant object. The investigating-consciousness, which arises after the
receiving-consciousness and considers the object, can be accompanied by
indifferent feeling or by pleasant feeling. When it is accompanied by
pleasant feeling, the object is extraordinarily pleasant. 

A pleasant object (iṭṭhārammaṇa) can have different
degrees of pleasantness. It can be just a pleasant object or an
extraordinarily pleasant object (adiṭṭhārammaṇa). If kusala vipākacitta
is the result of kusala kamma of great purity and accompanied by
pleasant feeling, it experiences an extraordinarily pleasant object, and
in that case the investigation-consciousness, the santīraṇa-citta, which
arises in a sense-door process and considers that object, is accompanied
by pleasant feeling. If the object experienced by the kusala
vipākacittas in a sense-door process is an object that is pleasant but
not extraordinarily pleasant, the investigating-consciousness is
accompanied by indifferent feeling.



3 Types of Ahetuka Kiriyacittas:

Kiriyacitta is the citta that is not kusala citta nor
akusala citta, cittas that are cause, and it is not vipākacitta, citta
that is result. Ahetuka kiriyacitta is the kiriyacitta not accompanied
by the cetasikas that are hetus. There are three types of ahetuka
kiriyacittas:

- five-sense-door adverting-consciousness, accompanied by
 indifferent feeling (upekkhā sahagataṃ pañcadvārāvajjana cittaṃ); 
- mind-door adverting-consciousness, accompanied by indifferent
 feeling (upekkhā sahagataṃ manodvārāvajjana cittaṃ); 
- smile-producing consciousness, accompanied by pleasant feeling
 (somanassa sahagataṃ hasituppāda cittaṃ). 



The five-sense-door adverting-consciousness,
pañcadvārāvajjana-citta,[^345] is the first vīthi-citta, citta
arising in a process, which experiences the object impinging on the eye,
ear, nose, tongue or bodysense. Kiriyacitta is different from
vipākacitta since it can experience both pleasant objects and unpleasant
objects. As regards vipākacitta, kusala vipākacitta experiences only a
pleasant object and akusala vipākacitta experiences only an unpleasant
object. 

When the five-sense-door adverting-consciousness arises,
it knows that an object impinges on the eyesense, or on one of the other
senses, and then it falls away. It is succeeded by seeing-consciousness
(or one of the other sense-cognitions), which experiences the same
object through the appropriate doorway and then falls away.
Seeing-consciousness or one of the other sense-cognitions is succeeded
by receiving-consciousness, which receives that object and then falls
away. Receiving-consciousness is succeeded by
investigating-consciousness, which considers that object and then falls
away. 

Before seeing-consciousness or one of the other
sense-cognitions arises and receives the result of kamma through the
relevant doorway, there must be a vīthi-citta that knows that an object
impinges on one of the sense-doors and this is the five-sense-door
adverting-consciousness. The function of this citta is called adverting,
āvajjana; the continuity of bhavanga-cittas is interrupted by this citta
and it adverts towards the object which impinges on one of the
sense-doors. When it has fallen away, it is succeeded by
seeing-consciousness or one of the other sense-cognitions that arises
and experiences a sense object through the relevant doorway.

The mind-door adverting-consciousness,
mano-dvārāvajjana-citta,[^346] is the first vīthi-citta that
arises and experiences an object through the mind-door. It is the citta
arising before akusala citta, kāmāvacara kusala citta, or in the case of
the arahat, kāmāvacara kiriyacitta. The mind-door
adverting-consciousness, mano-dvārāvajjana-citta, arises also in a
sense-door process, but then it does not perform the function of
adverting, but the function of determining the object, votthapana, and
it is called after its function votthapana-citta.[^347] In that
case, it succeeds the investigation-consciousness and it does not
experience the object through the mind-door, but through one of the
sense-doors. 

No matter whether the mind-door adverting-consciousness
arises in a sense-door process, succeeding the
investigating-consciousness, and performing the function of determining,
or whether it is the first citta in a mind-door process which
experiences the object through the mind-door, it is succeeded by akusala
citta, by kāmāvacara kusala citta or, in the case of the arahat, by
kāmāvacara kiriyacitta. The mind-door adverting-consciousness prepares
the way for the succeeding citta, which is, in the case of unwise
attention, akusala citta, and in the case of wise attention, kusala
citta (or kiriyacitta for the arahat), and this depends on the
accumulated inclinations. Thus, the mind-door adverting-consciousness
arises before akusala citta, kusala citta or kiriyacitta in the
processes of cittas experiencing an object through one of the six
doorways.

The smile-producing consciousness, hasituppāda-citta, is
an ahetuka kiriyacitta that conditions smiling only in the case of the
arahat, with regard to the six kinds of objects that can be experienced
through six doorways.



24 Types of Kāmāvacara Sobhana Cittas

The twenty-four types of kāmāvacara sobhana cittas are
beautiful cittas of the sense sphere, since they are accompanied by
beautiful cetasikas, sobhana cetasikas. 

The twenty-four types of sobhana cittas include eight
types of kāmāvacara kusala cittas (mahā-kusala cittas), eight types of
kāmāvacara vipākacittas (mahā-vipākacittas) and eight types of
kāmāvacara kiriyacittas (mahā-kiriyacittas). They are classified as
follows:



8 Types of Kāmāvacara Kusala Cittas:

1. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wisdom, unprompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). This
 type is accompanied by paññā cetasika (amoha) and it has strength,
 it arises without inducement. 
2. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wisdom, prompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). This
 type, which arises with paññā is weak, it arises by being dependent
 on inducement. 
3. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wisdom, unprompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-vippayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). This
 type, which arises without paññā, has strength, it arises without
 inducement. 
4. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wisdom, prompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-vippayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). This
 type, which arises without paññā is weak, it arises by being
 dependent on inducement. 
5. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wisdom, unprompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). This type,
 which arises with paññā, has strength, it arises without inducement.
6. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wisdom, prompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). This
 type, which arises with paññā is weak, it arises by being dependent
 on inducement. 
7. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wisdom, unprompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-vippayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). This type,
 which arises without paññā, has strength, it arises without
 inducement.
8. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wisdom, prompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-vippayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). This
 type, which arises without paññā is weak, it arises by being
 dependent on inducement. 



The cetanā cetasika (volition) that accompanies these
eight types of kusala cittas accomplishes kusala kamma consisting of ten
bases of meritorious deeds, puñña kiriya vatthu.[^348] These are
the following:

- Dāna or generosity, kusala accomplished by way of dāna, the giving
 away of useful things to someone else, 
- Sīla or morality, kusala accomplished by way of sīla, abstention
 from akusala kamma, 
- Bhāvanā or mental development, kusala accomplished through the
 development of samatha and of vipassanā, 
- Apacāyana or paying respect, kusala accomplished by paying respect
 to those who deserve it, 
- Veyyāvaca or rendering service, kusala accomplished by applying
 energy in helping someone else with the tasks that are to be done, 
- Pattidāna or sharing of merit, kusala accomplished by letting
 someone else know of one’s kusala so that he can appreciate it, 
- Pattanumodana or appreciation, kusala accomplished by the
 appreciation of someone else’s kusala, 
- Desanā or teaching, kusala accomplished by the teaching of the
 Dhamma, 
- Savana or listening, kusala accomplished by listening to the
 Dhamma, 
- Diṭṭhujukamma or correction of one’s views, kusala accomplished by
 acquiring right view of realities. 

Whenever the citta does not apply itself to one of these
ten meritorious deeds, it is not kusala citta.

Kāmāvacara kusala citta applies itself to dāna
(including giving, sharing of merit, appreciation of someone else’s
kusala), to sīla (including morality, paying respect and helping) or to
bhāvanā (including mental development, the teaching of the Dhamma,
listening to the Dhamma and correction of one’s views). Kāmāvacara
kusala citta arises in the processes of the five sense-doors and of the
mind-door, and therefore it is called mahā-kusala (mahā meaning: great).


When the eight types of kāmāvacara kusala citta arise
and accomplish kusala kamma, the accompanying cetanā, volition or
intention, is kamma-condition, kamma-paccaya, for the arising of
kāmāvacara kusala vipākacitta. There are sixteen types of results in
accordance with the kamma that produces them at the appropriate time.
These sixteen types of vipākacittas are: eight types of ahetuka kusala
vipākacittas and eight types of kāmāvacara sahetuka kusala vipākacittas
(mahā-vipākacittas).



8 Types of Kāmāvacara Sahetuka Kusala
Vipākacittas (Mahā-Vipākacittas):

1. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wisdom, unprompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
2. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wisdom, prompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
3. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wisdom, unprompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-vippayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
4. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wisdom, prompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-vippayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
5. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wisdom, unprompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
6. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wisdom, prompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
7. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wisdom, unprompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-vippayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 
8. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wisdom, prompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-vippayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). 



The eight types of mahā-vipākacittas are accompanied by
sobhana cetasikas; they are sahetuka kusala vipākacittas, with sobhana
hetus or roots. Thus, they are different from the eight types of ahetuka
kusala vipākacittas that are not accompanied by sobhana cetasikas.

The eight types of kāmāvacara sobhana kiriyacittas
(mahā-kiriyacittas) are cittas of the arahat who has eradicated all
defilements. Kusala citta or akusala citta, which are the cause for the
arising of vipākacitta in the future, do not arise anymore for him.
After he has attained arahatship, there are for him, instead of sobhana
cittas of the jāti (nature) of kusala, sobhana kiriyacittas.
Kiriyacittas do not cause the arising of vipākacitta anymore in the
future. Thus, the arahat has only vipākacitta, the result of kamma
performed in the past before attaining arahatship, and kiriyacitta,
which is not kusala citta, the cause for the arising of vipākacitta in
the future.



8 Types of Kāmāvacara Sobhana Kiriyacittas

(Sahetuka Kiriyacittas or Mahā-Kiriyacittas):

1. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wisdom, unprompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ).

15 Types of Rūpāvacara Cittas:

The fifteen types of rūpāvacara cittas are five types of
rūpāvacara kusala cittas, five types of rūpāvacara vipākacittas and five
types of rūpāvacara kiriyacittas. Rūpāvacara citta is of a higher degree
than kāmāvacara citta, because it is the citta that has reached freedom
from sense objects, by developing kāmāvacara kusala that is calm,
samatha. When calm has become more established, different degrees of
samādhi, concentration, can be attained. When samādhi is firmly fixed on
the meditation subject and it has reached the degree of attainment
concentration (appanā samādhi), the citta is rūpāvacara kusala citta
(rūpa-jhāna kusala citta), it is free of the sensuous plane of citta. 

5 Types of Rūpāvacara Kusala Cittas:

1. Kusala citta of the first jhāna, accompanied by the factors of
 applied thinking, sustained thinking, rapture, happy feeling and
 concentration (vitakka vicāra pīti sukh’ekaggatā sahitaṃ
 paṭhamajjhāna kusala-cittaṃ)[^349]; 
2. Kusala citta of the second jhāna, accompanied by sustained
 thinking, rapture, happy feeling and concentration (vicāra pīti
 sukh’ekaggatā sahitaṃ dutiyajjhāna kusalacittaṃ); 
3. Kusala citta of the third jhāna, accompanied by rapture, happy
 feeling and concentration (pīti sukh’ekaggatā sahitaṃ tatiyajjhāna
 kusalacittaṃ); 
4. Kusala citta of the fourth jhāna, accompanied by happy feeling and
 concentration (sukh’ekaggatā sahitaṃ catutthajjhāna kusalacittaṃ); 
5. Kusala citta of the fifth jhāna, accompanied by indifferent
 feeling and concentration (upekkh’ekaggatā sahitaṃ pañcamajjhāna
 kusala cittaṃ). 



The jhānacitta of the first stage is accompanied by five
factors, and as higher stages of jhāna are reached, jhāna factors are
successively abandoned. However, some people can abandon the two factors
of applied thinking and sustained thinking when the second stage is
reached, and thus, for them there are only four stages of jhāna. That is
why there is a fivefold system and a fourfold system of jhāna. The fifth
jhāna of the fivefold system is the same as the fourth jhāna of the
fourfold system.


5 Types of Rūpāvacara Vipākacittas:

1. Vipākacitta of the first jhāna, accompanied by the factors of
 applied thinking, sustained thinking, rapture, happy feeling and
 concentration (vitakka vicāra pīti sukh’ekaggatā sahitaṃ
 paṭhamajjhāna vipākacittaṃ); 
2. Vipākacitta of the second jhāna, accompanied by sustained
 thinking, rapture, happy feeling and concentration (vicāra pīti
 sukh’ekaggatā sahitaṃ dutiyajjhāna vipākacittaṃ);
3. Vipākacitta of the third jhāna, accompanied by rapture, happy
 feeling and concentration (pīti sukh’ekaggatā sahitaṃ tatiyajjhāna
 vipākacittaṃ); 
4. Vipākacitta of the fourth jhāna, accompanied by happy feeling and
 concentration (sukh’ekaggatā sahitaṃ catutthajjhāna vipākacittaṃ); 
5. Vipākacitta of the fifth jhāna, accompanied by indifferent feeling
 and concentration (upekkh’ekaggatā sahitaṃ pañcamajjhāna
 vipākacittaṃ). 



When rūpāvacara kusala citta has become strong, one can
achieve “masteries,” vasī.[^350] Someone with mastery in jhāna
has skill in determining the time he enters jhāna, in determining its
duration, which means, the time jhānacittas are arising and falling away
in an uninterrupted succession, and in determining the time of emerging
from jhāna, which means that there is an end to the succession of
jhānacittas. If his skill in jhāna does not decline, there is a
condition for the arising of kusala jhānacitta before the
dying-consciousness.

That jhānacitta is the condition for the arising of vipāka jhānacitta
that is the rebirth-consciousness of the next life in a rūpa-brahma
plane, in conformity with the degree of that jhāna.



5 Types of Rūpāvacara Kiriyacittas:

1. Kiriyacitta of the first jhāna, accompanied by the factors of
 applied thinking, sustained thinking, rapture, happy feeling and
 concentration (vitakka vicāra pīti sukh’ekaggatā sahitaṃ
 paṭhamajjhāna kiriyacittaṃ); 
2. Kiriyacitta of the second jhāna, accompanied by sustained
 thinking, rapture, happy feeling and concentration (vicāra pīti
 sukh’ekaggatā sahitaṃ dutiyajjhāna kiriyacittaṃ); 
3. Kiriyacitta of the third jhāna, accompanied by rapture, happy
 feeling and concentration (pīti sukh’ekaggatā sahitaṃ tatiyajjhāna
 kiriyacittaṃ); 
4. Kiriyacitta of the fourth jhāna, accompanied by happy feeling and
 concentration (sukh’ekaggatā sahitaṃ catutthajjhāna kiriyacittaṃ); 
5. Kiriyacitta of the fifth jhāna, accompanied by indifferent feeling
 and concentration (upekkh’ekaggatā sahitaṃ pañcamajjhāna
 kiriyacittaṃ). 



The rūpāvacara kiriyacitta is the citta of the arahat at
the moment of attainment concentration, appanā samādhi. The rūpāvacara
kiriyacitta does not condition the arising of rūpāvacara vipākacitta.






12 Types of Arūpāvacara Cittas:

The arūpāvacara jhāna-cittas are of the same type as the
jhānacitta of the fifth stage, accompanied by the same jhāna-factors,
but they do not have a meditation subject dependent on rūpa. Someone who
has attained the fifth stage of rūpa-jhāna wishes to abandon the
meditation subject of rūpa-jhāna which is still dependent on materiality
and, thus, close to a sense object. He is inclined to meditate on a
subject that is immaterial and infinite. The twelve types of arūpāvacara
cittas are: four types of arūpāvacara kusala cittas, four types of
arūpāvacara vipākacittas and four types of arūpāvacara kiriyacittas.



4 Types of Arūpāvacara Kusala Cittas:

1. Kusala jhānacitta that has the object of “Infinity of Space”
 (Ākāsānañcāyatana[^351] kusalacittaṃ); 
2. Kusala jhānacitta that has the object of “Infinity of
 Consciousness” (Viññāṇañcāyatana[^352] kusalacittaṃ); 
3. Kusala jhānacitta that has the object of “Nothingness”
 (Ākiñcaññāyatana[^353] kusalacittaṃ); 
4. Kusala jhānacitta that has the object of “Neither Perception nor
 Non-Perception” (N’eva-saññā-n’āsaññāyatana[^354]
 kusalacittaṃ). 



The arūpa-jhānacittas are of the same type of citta as
the rūpa-jhānacitta of the fifth stage and therefore, they are also
called arūpa pañcama jhānacitta.[^355] 

The first type of arūpa-jhāna kusala citta meditates on
the subject of space that is of an extension without limits, which is
infinite. 

The second type of arūpa-jhāna kusala citta meditates on
infinite consciousness; its object is the arūpa-jhānacitta of the first
stage experiencing infinite space. 

The third type of arūpa-jhāna kusala citta meditates on
the subject of “nothing.” Someone who has reached this stage knows that
this subject is even more refined than that of the second stage of
arūpa-jhāna, the citta experiencing infinite space. 

The fourth type of arūpa-jhāna kusala citta meditates on
the arūpa-jhānacitta of the third stage, which has “nothingness” as
subject. Someone who has reached this stage knows that even when the
subject is “nothing,” there is still citta that dwells on this subject.
The jhānacitta of the stage of “neither perception-nor-non-perception,”
which has as subject the citta experiencing “nothing,” is of the highest
stage of arūpa -jhāna; it is very subtle and refined. At that moment, it
cannot be said that there is perception, nor can it be said that there
is no perception. 

If someone has acquired “mastery” in arūpa-jhāna and his
skill in arūpa-jhāna does not decline, there are conditions for the
arising of arūpa-jhāna kusala citta before the dying-consciousness. That
jhānacitta is the condition for the arising of arūpa-jhāna vipākacitta
that is the rebirth-consciousness of the next life in an arūpa-brahma
plane, in conformity with the degree of that jhāna.



4 Types of Arūpāvacara Vipākacittas:

1. Vipāka jhānacitta that has the object of “Infinity of Space”
 (Ākāsānañcāyatana vipākacittaṃ);
2. Vipāka jhānacitta that has the object of “Infinity of
 Consciousness” (Viññāṇañcāyatana vipākacittaṃ);
3. Vipāka jhānacitta that has the object of “Nothingness”
 (Ākiñcaññāyatana vipākacittaṃ);
4. Vipāka jhānacitta that has the object of “Neither Perception nor
 Non-Perception” (N’eva-saññā-n’āsaññāyatana vipākacittaṃ).



When one of the arūpa-jhāna vipākacittas performs the
function of rebirth for someone, he is reborn in one of the arūpa-brahma
planes, in conformity with the degree of the arūpa-jhāna vipākacitta. He
leads the life of a heavenly being in that arūpa-brahma plane until,
when life in that plane has come to an end, he passes away. During the
time he is a heavenly being of the arūpa-brahma world, there arises for
him no rūpakkhandha, only the four nāmakkhandhas. Thus, he is a being
without rūpa.



4 Types of Arūpāvacara Kiriyacittas:

1. Kiriya jhānacitta that has the object of “Infinity of Space”
 (Ākāsānañcāyatana kiriyacittaṃ);
2. Kiriya jhānacitta that has the object of “Infinity of
 Consciousness” (Viññāṇañcāyatana kiriyacittaṃ); 
3. Kiriya jhānacitta that has the object of “Nothingness”
 (Ākiñcaññāyatana kiriyacittaṃ);
4. Kiriya jhānacitta that has the object of “Neither Perception nor
 Non-Perception” (N’eva-saññā-n’āsaññāyatana kiriyacittaṃ). 



The arūpāvacara kiriyacitta is the citta of the arahat
who has developed samatha to the degree of arūpa-jhāna. After he has
realized the four noble Truths at the attainment of arahatship, the
arūpāvacara citta that arises is kiriyacitta, it is no longer
arūpāvacara kusala citta.



8 Types of Lokuttara Cittas:

Lokuttara cittas directly realize the characteristic of
nibbāna. Four types are lokuttara kusala cittas that eradicate
defilements and four types are lokuttara vipākacittas arising after
defilements have been eradicated.

The eight types of lokuttara cittas are:

1. Path-consciousness of the stream winner, kusala citta (sotāpatti
 magga-citta); 
2. Fruition-consciousness of the stream winner, vipākacitta
 (sotāpatti phala-citta); 
3. Path-consciousness of the once-returner, kusala citta (sakadāgāmī
 magga-citta); 
4. Fruition-consciousness of the once-returner, vipākacitta
 (sakadāgāmī phala-citta); 
5. Path-consciousness of the non-returner, kusala citta (anāgāmī
 magga-citta); 
6. Fruition-consciousness of the non-returner, vipākacitta (anāgāmī
 phala-citta); 
7. Path-consciousness of the arahat, kusala citta (arahatta
 magga-citta); 
8. Fruition-consciousness of the arahat, vipākacitta (arahatta
 phala-citta). 



When kāmāvacara kusala citta (of the sense sphere)
accompanied by paññā arises and investigates the characteristics of nāma
and rūpa, their characteristics can be realized as they are and clinging
to the wrong view of realities can be eliminated. When the different
stages of insight-knowledge, vipassanā ñāṇa,[^356] have been
successively attained, lokuttara citta can arise. Lokuttara magga-citta
directly realizes the characteristic of nibbāna and eradicates
defilements in accordance with the stage of enlightenment that has been
attained. 

The lokuttara kusala citta which is the
path-consciousness, magga-citta, of the sotāpanna, arises only once in
the cycle of birth and death. It performs the function of eradicating
the defilements of wrong view, doubt, avarice and envy. Moreover, it
eliminates the conditions for akusala kamma of the intensity of leading
to an unhappy rebirth. 

When the magga-citta of the sotāpanna has fallen away,
it is immediately succeeded by the phala-citta, which is lokuttara
vipākacitta. The magga-citta of the sotāpanna is kusala kamma that
produces result immediately; it conditions the arising of the
phala-citta, which is lokuttara vipākacitta, without another citta
arising in between. The phala-citta also experiences nibbāna as object,
but it is different from the magga-citta: the magga-citta experiences
nibbāna and eradicates defilements, whereas the phala-citta receives
result, it experiences nibbāna after defilements have been eradicated
already. 

The magga-citta of the sakadāgāmī arises only once in
the cycle of birth and death. It performs the function of eradicating
the coarse attachment to visible object, sound, odour, flavour and
tangible object. When the magga-citta has fallen away, it is immediately
succeeded by the phala-citta, which also experiences nibbāna as object
after defilements have been eradicated. 

The magga-citta of the anāgāmī arises only once in the
cycle of birth and death. It performs the function of eradicating the
more refined attachment to the sense objects. When the magga-citta has
fallen away, it is immediately succeeded by the phala-citta, which also
experiences nibbāna as object after defilements have been eradicated. 

The magga-citta of the arahat arises only once in the
cycle of birth and death. It performs the function of completely
eradicating all the remaining defilements. When the magga-citta has
fallen away, it is immediately succeeded by the phala-citta, which also
experiences nibbāna as object after all defilements have been completely
eradicated.







40 Types of Lokuttara Cittas:

Those who have developed samatha and acquired great
skill in jhāna, who are “jhāna lābhī,”[^357] can have kāmāvacara
citta accompanied by paññā arising in between jhānacittas of any stage;
in that case, paññā can investigate the characteristics of nāma and rūpa
appearing at that moment. When paññā investigates the characteristics of
nāma and rūpa and knows them more clearly, the clinging to the wrong
view of self can be eliminated. When lokuttara citta of one of the
stages of enlightenment arises, it can have jhāna of one of the stages
of jhāna as base or foundation, that is, the jhānacitta that was object
of satipaṭṭhāna. In that case, the magga-citta and the phala-citta are
lokuttara jhānacittas accompanied by the jhāna-factors of the jhānacitta
that was their base, and thus, there are forty lokuttara cittas,
classified as follows:

- Magga-citta of the sotāpanna with factors of the first, second,
 third, fourth and fifth stage of jhāna;[^358]
- Phala-citta of the sotāpanna with factors of the first, second,
 third, fourth and fifth stage of jhāna; 
- Magga-citta of the sakadāgāmī with factors of the first, second,
 third, fourth and fifth stage of jhāna; 
- Phala-citta of the sakadāgāmī with factors of the first, second,
 third, fourth and fifth stage of jhāna; 
- Magga-citta of the anāgāmī with factors of the first, second,
 third, fourth and fifth stage of jhāna; 
- Phala-citta of the anāgāmī with factors of the first, second,
 third, fourth and fifth stage of jhāna; 
- Magga-citta of the arahat with factors of the first, second,
 third, fourth and fifth stage of jhāna; 
- Phala-citta of the arahat with factors of the first, second,
 third, fourth and fifth stage of jhāna. 



The magga-cittas of the four stages of enlightenment can
arise only once in the cycle of birth and death. However, the
phala-cittas which are lokuttara jhāna vipākacittas can arise again,
provided the person who attained lokuttara jhāna is so skilful in jhāna
that there are conditions for the arising of lokuttara jhāna vipākacitta
in other processes. The lokuttara jhānacitta that arises in a process
other than that during which the magga-citta eradicated defilements, is
the lokuttara jhāna vipākacitta (the phala-citta) which is called
“fruition attainment,” phala samāpatti. During “fruition attainment”,
lokuttara jhāna vipākacittas arise and fall away in succession without
there being other cittas in between.
