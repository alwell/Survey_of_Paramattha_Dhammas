Kamāvacara cittas are cittas of the lowest level, and
they usually arise and fall away in daily life, each moment, no matter
whether we are asleep or awake. The sense objects, which are rūpa
paramattha dhamma, are experienced by kāmāvacara cittas. Among the
twenty-eight rūpa paramattha dhammas, seven kinds of rūpas appear as
objects in daily life through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue,
the bodysense and the mind-door. These rūpas, which are the objects
citta usually experiences, are called in Pāli: gocara visaya rūpas.
Gocara means pasture and visaya means sphere, object. The gocara visaya
rūpas are:

- visible object or colour, rūpārammaṇa or vaṇṇa, which appears when
 it impinges on the eyesense; 
- sound, saddārammaṇa, which appears when it impinges on the
 earsense; 
- odour, gandhārammaṇa, which appears when it impinges on the
 smelling-sense; 
- flavour, rasārammaṇa, which appears when it impinges on the
 tasting-sense; 
- tangible objects, phoṭṭhabbārammaṇa, the three rūpas of
 earth-element (softness or hardness), heat-element (cold or heat)
 and wind-element (pressure or motion), which appear when they
 impinge on the bodysense. 

The cittas that arise and fall away all the time in
daily life are usually of the level of kāmāvacara cittas. They are
engaged in the seven kinds of sense objects; they experience these rūpas
through the appropriate doorways or they think about them.

- akusala cittas: 
12 types
- ahetuka (rootless) cittas:  
     18 types

cittas of the sense sphere):     
  24 types

12 Types of Akusala Cittas:

Akusala citta is the citta that is not wholesome, not
beautiful, because it is accompanied by akusala cetasikas. The twelve
types of akusala cittas are:

- lobha-mūla-cittas (cittas rooted in attachment):    
8 types
- dosa-mūla-cittas (cittas rooted in aversion): 
2 types
- moha-mūla-cittas (cittas rooted in ignorance):    
2 types



Mūla means root. There are three cetasikas which are the
cause or origin of akusala dhammas: lobha cetasika (attachment), dosa
cetasika (aversion) and moha cetasika (ignorance). These three cetasikas
are roots, mūla or hetu. 

Lobha-mūla-citta: the citta accompanied by lobha
cetasika, which is the condition for delight in and clinging to the
object that appears. Lobha-mūla-cittas are classified as eight types:

1. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wrong view, unprompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ).
 This type is accompanied by pleasant feeling, a feeling of
 happiness, and it is associated with the cetasika diṭṭhi, wrong view
 about realities. It is unprompted, asaṅkhārika, which means that it
 has strength, it arises without being dependent on inducement. 

2. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wrong view, prompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ).
 This type is accompanied by pleasant feeling and it is associated
 with wrong view. It is prompted, sasaṅkhārika, which means that it
 is weak, it arises by being dependent on inducement. 

3. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wrong view, unprompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-vippayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ).
 This type is accompanied by pleasant feeling and it is without wrong
 view; it is not accompanied by diṭṭhi cetasika. It has strength, it
 arises without being dependent on inducement. 

4. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wrong view, prompted
 (somanassa-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-vippayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ).
 This type is accompanied by pleasant feeling and it is without wrong
 view. It is weak, it arises by being dependent on inducement. 

5. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wrong view, unprompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). This
 type is accompanied by indifferent feeling, feeling which is neither
 pleasant nor unpleasant. It is associated with wrong view. It has
 strength, it arises without being dependent on inducement. 

6. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wrong view, prompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ).
 This type is accompanied by indifferent feeling. It is associated
 with wrong view. It is weak, it arises by being dependent on
 inducement. 

7. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wrong view, unprompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-vippayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). This
 type is accompanied by indifferent feeling. It is without wrong
 view. It has strength, it arises without being dependent on
 inducement. 

8. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wrong view, prompted
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, diṭṭhigata-vippayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ).
 This type is accompanied by indifferent feeling. It is without wrong
 view. It is weak, it arises by being dependent on inducement. 



Dosa-mūla-citta: the citta accompanied by dosa cetasika,
the dhamma that is coarse and harsh, which dislikes the object it
experiences. There are two types of dosa-mūla-citta:

1. Accompanied by unpleasant feeling, with anger, unprompted
 (domanassa-sahagataṃ, paṭigha-sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). This
 type, which is accompanied by unhappy feeling, arises together with
 paṭigha, dosa cetasika, the dhamma that is coarse and harsh. It has
 strength, it arises without being dependent on inducement. 

2. Accompanied by unpleasant feeling, with anger, prompted
 (domanassa-sahagataṃ, paṭigha-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ). This
 type is different from the first type in as far as it is weak: it
 arises by being dependent on inducement. 



Moha-mūla-citta: the citta accompanied by moha cetasika,
the dhamma that is deluded, which does not know the truth of realities.
There are two types of moha-mūla-citta:

1. Arising with indifferent feeling, accompanied by doubt
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, vicikicchā-sampayuttaṃ). Moha-mūla-citta arises
 together with indifferent feeling and this type is accompanied by
 doubt, vicikicchā cetasika, which is doubt about the truth of
 realities. 

2. Arising with indifferent feeling, accompanied by restlessness
 (upekkhā-sahagataṃ, uddhacca-sampayuttaṃ). This type, which arises
 also with indifferent feeling, is accompanied by restlessness or
 agitation (uddhacca cetasika). 



Each citta is accompanied by several types of cetasikas.
Cittas are accompanied by a different number of cetasikas depending on
the type of citta concerned. Each citta is accompanied by feeling,
vedanā cetasika, which is different depending on the type of citta. 

Each type of akusala citta is accompanied by four
akusala cetasikas (akusala sādhāraṇa[340](#ftn340) cetasikas) which are:
moha cetasika; shamelessness, ahirika cetasika, which has no shame of
evil; lack of moral dread, anottappa cetasika, which does not fear the
danger of akusala; restlessness or agitation, uddhacca cetasika, which
is involved with akusala dhammas. 

The twelve akusala cittas can be differentiated with
regard to their roots (mūla, the three akusala hetus of lobha, dosa and
moha), and then they are classified as follows:

- moha-mūla-citta, which is not accompanied by lobha cetasika nor by
 dosa cetasika, 
- dosa-mūla-citta, which is not accompanied by lobha cetasika, 
- lobha-mūla-citta, which is not accompanied by dosa cetasika. 



The twelve akusala cittas can be differentiated with
regard to three accompanying feelings, namely, indifferent feeling,
pleasant feeling and unpleasant feeling:

- Indifferent feeling, upekkhā vedanā cetasika, accompanies
 lobha-mūla-citta and moha-mūla-citta. It does not accompany
 dosa-mūla-citta. 
- Pleasant feeling, somanassa vedanā cetasika, accompanies
 lobha-mūla-citta. It does not accompany dosa-mūla-citta and
 moha-mūla-citta. 
- Unpleasant feeling, domanassa vedanā cetasika, only accompanies
 the two types of dosa-mūla-citta. It does not accompany any other
 type of citta. 



With regard to the second type of moha-mūla-citta, which
arises with indifferent feeling and is accompanied by restlessness
(upekkhā-sahagataṃ, uddhacca-sampayuttaṃ), this type is not accompanied
by doubt (vicikicchā), but it is akusala citta since it is accompanied
by akusala cetasikas. When there is akusala citta that is not one of the
eight types of lobha-mūla-citta, one of the two types of dosa-mūla-citta
or moha-mūla-citta accompanied by doubt, it is moha-mūla-citta
accompanied by restlessness. 

When akusala citta is strong, there is a condition for
the accompanying cetanā (volition or intention) to commit one of the ten
evil courses of action, kamma-patha. The ten akusala kamma-pathas are
the following:

- Three kinds of bodily action (kāyakamma): the killing of living
 beings (pāṇātipāto), stealing, which is taking what has not been
 given (adinnādānaṃ), and sexual misconduct (kāmesu micchācāro). 
- Four kinds of verbal action (vacīkamma): lying (musāvādo), rough
 speech (pharusavācā), slandering (pisuṇavācā) and idle talk
 (samphappalāpo).
- Three kinds of mental action (manokamma): covetousness or planning
 to take away someone else’s property (abhijjhā), ill will or wishing
 to hurt or harm someone else (vyāpādo) and wrong view
 (micchādiṭṭhi). Not every kind of wrong view is akusala kamma-patha.
 Wrong view that is akusala kamma-patha are the three following
 views: 

1. Natthika[341](#ftn341) diṭṭhi, denial of the result of kamma; any
 result that arises does not originate from kamma.[342](#ftn342) 
2. Ahetuka diṭṭhi, denial of both kamma and result. Kamma does not
 produce result, whatever arises has no condition, no
 cause.[343](#ftn343) 
3. Akiriya diṭṭhi, denial of the efficacy of kamma. Kamma, action, is
 merely a behaviour by way of the body; there are no good and bad
 actions that produce results.[344](#ftn344)



When the akusala citta that motivates akusala
kamma-patha has fallen away, the cetanā cetasika (volition), which arose
and fell away together with the akusala citta, is kamma-condition,
kamma-paccaya, for the arising of akusala vipākacitta. There are seven
types of akusala vipākacittas which are the results of kamma and which
arise when it is the appropriate time.
