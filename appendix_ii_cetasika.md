# Appendix II: Cetasika

52 Types of Cetasikas

- Aññāsamāna cetasikas:13 types
- Akusala cetasikas: 14 types
- Sobhana cetasikas: 25 types



The aññāsamāna cetasikas are of the same nature (jāti)
as the other cetasikas they accompany.[359](#ftn359) When aññāsamāna
cetasika accompanies akusala cetasikas, it is also akusala, and when it
accompanies sobhana cetasikas it is also sobhana. The aññāsamāna
cetasikas can accompany akusala cetasikas as well as sobhana cetasikas.


The thirteen aññāsamāna cetasikas can be classified as
two categories: seven universals (sabbacitta sādhāraṇā
cetasikas)[360](#ftn360) and six particulars (pakiṇṇakā
cetasikas)[361](#ftn361). The seven universals are cetasikas
accompanying each type of citta. Every citta that arises has to be
accompanied by at least seven cetasikas, the seven universals. The five
pairs of sense-cognitions (seeing, hearing, etc. which can be kusala
vipāka or akusala vipāka), are only accompanied by the seven universals,
not by other cetasikas. Thus, they are accompanied by the smallest
number of cetasikas. The other types of citta are accompanied by more
than these seven cetasikas, depending on the type of citta concerned. 

7 Universals:

1. Contact, phassa cetasika, contacts the object. When phassa
 cetasika arises and contacts an object, it is a condition for the
 citta and the other cetasikas arising together with it to perform
 each their own function with regard to that object. Citta, phassa
 and the other cetasikas arise, perform each their own function and
 then fall away very rapidly. When phassa contacts the object, it
 conditions that object to appear, so that also the other cetasikas
 can perform their specific functions as they, each in their own way,
 partake of the object, such as like (lobha) or dislike (dosa)
 towards the object. Phassa, contact, is food, āhāra, which sustains,
 which brings its fruit; it is food for the citta and cetasikas that
 arise together and manifest their specific characteristics while
 they perform their functions. Therefore, phassa cetasika is
 nutrition-condition, āhāra-paccaya, for the citta and the other
 cetasikas arising together with it.[362](#ftn362) 

2. Feeling, vedanā cetasika, is the cetasika that feels. When citta
 arises and cognizes an object, the feeling that arises together with
 the citta feels with regard to that object. It can be pleasant
 feeling, unpleasant feeling, bodily pleasant feeling, painful
 feeling or indifferent feeling. Feeling cetasika accompanies each
 citta and it is different depending on the type of citta it
 accompanies. For example, unpleasant feeling accompanies
 dosa-mūla-citta, and indifferent feeling can accompany
 moha-mūla-citta or lobha-mūla-citta. 

3. Remembrance or perception, saññā cetasika, remembers or “marks”
 the object so that it can be recognized. Saññā cetasika remembers
 each object that appears; it remembers the different objects
 appearing one after the other as a “whole,” as a story, a concept of
 beings and people. Saññā remembers pleasant feeling, unpleasant
 feeling, bodily pleasant and painful feeling and indifferent feeling
 with regard to each object that appears. Saññā cetasika is an
 important condition inciting to attachment and clinging in life. It
 is the same in the case of feeling cetasika: when one, for example,
 feels happy or glad, one attaches great importance to such feeling,
 one clings to it and wishes it to continue all the time. Therefore,
 vedanā cetasika and saññā cetasika are each a separate khandha among
 the five khandhas. The other fifty cetasikas are saṅkhārakkhandha,
 the khandha of “formations” or “activities.” They condition citta
 each in their own way, in conformity with their different
 characteristics. 

4. Volition, cetanā cetasika, wills or intends; it is active in
 fulfilling its own task and in coordinating the tasks of the nāma
 dhammas arising together with it at that moment. Cetanā cetasika is
 kamma-condition, kamma-paccaya. Cetanā cetasika accompanying
 vipākacitta is conascent kamma-condition,
 sahajāta-kamma-paccaya,[363](#ftn363) it performs its function as
 cetanā that is vipāka, arising together with vipākacitta and the
 other cetasikas that are also vipāka[364](#ftn364) and then it falls
 away. Cetanā cetasika that is kiriya is also conascent
 kamma-condition. It performs its function as it arises together with
 kiriyacitta and the other cetasikas that are kiriya cetasikas, and
 then it falls away. However, akusala cetanā which accompanies
 akusala citta and accomplishes akusala kamma patha (course of action
 which is completed) and kusala cetanā which accompanies kusala citta
 and accomplishes kusala kamma patha, are, after they have fallen
 away, “kamma-condition operating from a different moment,”
 nānā-khaṇika kamma-paccaya.[365](#ftn365) This type of kamma
 produces vipāka citta and cetasikas arising later on. Thus, when
 akusala cetanā and kusala cetanā that are cause, have fallen away,
 they can produce results in the form of vipākacitta and cetasikas
 later on, at a time different from the actual committing of evil and
 good deeds. That is why they are kamma-condition operating from a
 different time, nānā-khaṇika kamma-paccaya. 

5. One-pointedness or concentration, ekaggatā cetasika, focuses on
 the object that is experienced. Whatever object citta cognizes,
 one-pointedness focuses on that object. However, one-pointedness
 accompanying akusala citta is not of the same strength of
 concentration as that accompanying kusala citta. When, in the
 development of samatha, citta knows the same object again and again,
 for a long time, the characteristic of one-pointedness, which
 concentrates on the object as it accompanies each citta at those
 moments, appears as samādhi, concentration, and it can be of
 different degrees. When ekaggatā that is kusala concentrates on the
 object, it is right concentration, sammā-samādhi, and it can develop
 so that it successively reaches higher levels. 

6. Life faculty or vitality, jīvitindriya, is the cetasika that
 sustains the life of the accompanying citta and cetasikas, until
 they fall away. The nāma-dhammas that arise and subsist just for an
 extremely short moment still need as condition jīvitindriya cetasika
 which arises together with them and maintains their life at that
 moment. Jīvitindriya cetasika is faculty-condition, indriya-paccaya,
 for the citta and cetasikas it accompanies; it is a
 “leader”[366](#ftn366) in watching over the accompanying dhammas so
 that they subsist just for a moment before they fall away. 

7. Attention or manasikāra, is the cetasika that is attentive to the
 object, that takes an interest in it. Attention to the object is a
 condition for the accompanying cetasikas to “think” of or to occupy
 themselves with the object. They think each in their own way of
 different subjects and condition a variety of effects in the field
 of science and worldly knowledge, which is endless. This kind of
 knowledge is different from knowledge in the field of Dhamma. 



The seven universals, the sabbacitta sādhāraṇā
cetasikas, are of the same nature or jāti as the citta they accompany.
When they accompany kusala citta, they are kusala; when they accompany
akusala citta, they are akusala; when they accompany vipākacitta, they
are vipāka; when they accompany kiriyacitta, they are kiriya. They are
also of the same level of citta they accompany: when they accompany
kāmāvacara citta they are kāmāvacara; when they accompany rūpāvacara
citta, they are rūpāvacara; when they accompany arūpāvacara citta, they
are arūpāvacara; when they accompany lokuttara citta, they are
lokuttara. 



6 Particulars:

The six particulars are cetasikas that can arise with
akusala cetasikas or with sobhana cetasikas. They do not accompany every
citta.

1. Applied thinking, vitakka cetasika, touches the object which
 phassa cetasika contacts. Applied thinking accompanies fifty-five
 kāmāvacara cittas and eleven jhānacittas of the first
 stage.[367](#ftn367) It does not arise with the five pairs of
 sense-cognitions nor does it arise with the jhānacittas of the
 second stage up to the fifth stage. Applied thinking touches the
 object, it “thinks” of it in accordance with the citta and cetasikas
 it accompanies.[368](#ftn368) Applied thinking, which thinks of the
 object, is like the feet of the world; it causes the world to
 progress, as it accompanies the citta which cognizes the object. 

2. Sustained thinking, vicāra cetasika, is the cetasika that supports
 vitakka cetasika. Whatever vitakka thinks of, vicāra cetasika
 supports vitakka with regard to its thinking. Sustained thinking
 accompanies sixty-six cittas, namely, forty-four kāmāvacara cittas,
 eleven jhānacittas of the first stage and eleven jhānacittas of the
 second stage. Sustained thinking does not accompany the five pairs
 of sense-cognitions nor does it accompany the jhānacittas of the
 third stage up to the fifth stage. Whatever citta is accompanied by
 applied thinking is also accompanied by sustained thinking, except
 in the case of the eleven jhānacittas of the second stage, which are
 accompanied by sustained thinking but not by applied thinking. 

3. Determination, adhimokkha cetasika, is fixed on the object, it is
 convinced about it and it does not doubt about it. Determination
 accompanies eighty-seven types of citta. It does not arise with the
 five pairs of sense-cognitions, nor does it arise with the type of
 moha-mūla-citta that is accompanied by doubt, vicikicchā. It cannot
 arise with moha-mūla-citta accompanied by doubt, since it is
 convinced about the object and does not doubt about it. 

4. Energy, viriya cetasika, is the cetasika which makes an effort,
 strives, and which consolidates the accompanying dhammas so that
 they do not regress. Energy accompanies seventy-three types of
 citta. It does not accompany sixteen ahetuka cittas, namely, the
 sense-door adverting-consciousness, the five pairs of
 sense-cognitions, the two types of receiving-consciousness and the
 three types of investigating-consciousness (santīraṇa citta). These
 sixteen ahetuka cittas each perform their own function and they do
 not need energy as a condition. 

5. Enthusiasm or rapture, pīti cetasika, is delighted, satisfied and
 thrilled, and therefore, it can only arise together with pleasant
 feeling, not with other kinds of feeling. Enthusiasm or rapture
 arises together with fifty-one types of citta which are accompanied
 by pleasant feeling, namely, eighteen types of kāmāvacara cittas,
 eleven types of jhānacitta of the first stage, eleven types of
 jhānacitta of the second stage and eleven types of jhānacitta of the
 third stage. The eleven jhānacittas of the fourth stage (of the
 fivefold system) are accompanied by pleasant feeling, but not by
 rapture. This stage of jhānacitta is more refined than the third
 stage of jhānacitta, which is still accompanied by rapture. At the
 fourth stage, one can forgo rapture. 

6. Zeal or desire-to-act, chanda cetasika, is the cetasika that
 desires to act. This cetasika accompanies sixty-nine types of citta.
 It does not accompany twenty types of citta, namely, the eighteen
 ahetuka cittas, and the two types of moha-mūla-citta. When rootless
 cittas arise, there is no desire to act. Moha-mūla-citta is
 accompanied by the root of moha, but since there are no lobha or
 dosa arising together with it, it is not accompanied by chanda
 cetasika, which desires to act. Chanda cetasika is the reality that
 desires to act in conformity with lobha-mūla-citta, dosa-mūla-citta
 or the other cittas it accompanies.





14 Types of Akusala Cetasikas:

Akusala cetasikas are not wholesome or beautiful. When
the citta is accompanied by akusala cetasikas, it is akusala citta.
Therefore, akusala cetasikas can only accompany the twelve akusala
cittas, they cannot accompany kusala citta, vipākacitta or kiriyacitta.
It depends on the type of akusala citta by which akusala cetasikas it is
accompanied, but each akusala citta must be accompanied by the four
akusala cetasikas of ignorance, moha, shamelessness, ahirika,
recklessness, anottappa and restlessness, uddhacca. These four akusala
cetasikas are common to all akusala cittas, they are called in Pāli:
akusala sādhāraṇā cetasikas. Apart from these four akusala cetasikas,
other akusala cetasikas accompany akusala cittas as the case demands.

1. Ignorance, moha cetasika, does not know the characteristics of
 realities as they really are. Moha cetasika accompanies all twelve
 akusala cittas.

2. Shamelessness, ahirika cetasika, is not ashamed of akusala
 dhammas. It accompanies all twelve akusala cittas.

3. Recklessness, anottappa cetasika, is not afraid of the danger of
 akusala dhammas. It accompanies all twelve akusala cittas.

4. Restlessness, uddhacca cetasika, is the cetasika that is not calm,
 which is distracted with regard to the object that is experienced.
 It accompanies all twelve akusala cittas.

5. Attachment, lobha cetasika, is the cetasika that clings, that
 desires the object. It accompanies the eight types of
 lobha-mūla-citta.

6. Wrong view, diṭṭhi cetasika, is wrong view of realities. It
 conditions clinging to the ways of wrong practice that is not the
 right cause leading to the right result. It conditions someone to
 cling to superstitious beliefs or to be excited about auspicious
 signs. Whenever someone has wrong view and strives after the wrong
 practice of the Dhamma through body, speech or mind, there is diṭṭhi
 cetasika, which can arise with four types of lobha-mūla-citta, those
 which are diṭṭhigata sampayutta (accompanied by diṭṭhi). When the
 magga-citta of the sotāpanna arises which realizes the four noble
 Truths, diṭṭhi cetasika is completely eradicated so that it does not
 arise again. Thus, the sotāpanna does not have anymore the four
 types of lobha-mūla-citta accompanied by diṭṭhi.

7. Conceit, māna cetasika, arises when one finds oneself important,
 when one is proud. It can arise only with the four types of
 lobha-mūla-citta that are without wrong view, diṭṭhi, but it does
 not always accompany these types. Sometimes lobha-mūla-cittas
 without wrong view are accompanied by conceit and sometimes they are
 not. Only when the four noble Truths have been realized at the stage
 of arahatship, conceit is completely eradicated so that it does not
 arise again.

8. Aversion, dosa cetasika, is the cetasika that is coarse; it is the
 reality that injures or harms, that is anxious or irritated. It
 accompanies the two types of dosa-mūla-citta. When the four noble
 Truths have been realized at the third stage of enlightenment, the
 stage of the non-returner, anāgāmī, dosa is completely eradicated.
 Thus, the sotāpanna can be sad and sorrowful, because he still has
 the two types of dosa-mūla-citta.

9. Envy, issā cetasika, is the cetasika that is jealous of someone
 else’s prosperity, his material possessions, his wealth or his good
 qualities. Envy can arise with the two types of dosa-mūla-citta, but
 it does not invariably accompany them. Sometimes dosa-mūla-citta is
 accompanied by envy, sometimes it is not. When the magga-citta of
 the sotāpanna realizes the four noble Truths, envy is completely
 eradicated. Thus, the ariyans do not have envy anymore.

10. Stinginess or avarice, macchariya cetasika, arises when someone
 is stingy with regard to his own property, when he does not want to
 share it with someone else, and does not want someone else to
 receive benefit from it. Avarice arises together with the two types
 of dosa-mūla-citta, it does not accompany lobha-mūla-citta. When
 avarice arises, there is anxiety and unhappiness with the citta, and
 therefore, it could not arise with lobha-mūla-citta that is
 accompanied by indifferent feeling or by pleasant feeling. Avarice
 is always accompanied by unpleasant feeling. Dosa-mūla-citta is
 sometimes accompanied by avarice, sometimes not. Avarice is
 completely eradicated when the magga-citta of the sotāpanna arises
 and realizes the four noble Truths. Thus, the ariyans do not have
 avarice anymore. As regards the lay follower who is ariyan but not
 yet arahat,[369](#ftn369) he has not given up all his possessions,
 because he still has lobha cetasika. However, he has no avarice,
 since it was eradicated at the stage of enlightenment of the
 sotāpanna. He follows the right Path and when there is a proper
 occasion, he can generously give away things to others.

11. Worry or regret, kukkucca cetasika, is the cetasika that is
 anxiety and regret about the akusala that has been committed and the
 kusala that has been omitted. It can arise with the two types of
 dosa-mūla-citta. Dosa-mūla-citta is sometimes accompanied by regret
 and sometimes not. Regret has been completely eradicated by the
 magga-citta of the anāgāmī.

12. Sloth, thīna cetasika, is the cetasika which causes the citta to
 be listless, to lack energy for kusala. It can arise with the five
 types of akusala cittas which are prompted, sasaṅkhārika, thus with
 the four lobha mūla-cittas which are sasaṅkhārika and with one type
 of dosa-mūla-citta, the type which is sasaṅkhārika. The akusala
 cittas that are sasaṅkhārika are sometimes accompanied by sloth,
 sometimes not.

13. Torpor, middha cetasika, is the cetasika that causes the
 accompanying cetasikas to be inert and drowsy. It can arise with the
 five types of akusala cittas that are sasaṅkhārika, just as in the
 case of sloth. Sloth and torpor always arise together, they cannot
 be separated. Sloth and torpor are eradicated by the magga-citta of
 the arahat.

14. Doubt, vicikicchā cetasika, is doubt about the characteristics of
 nāma and rūpa, about the four noble Truths, about the Buddha, the
 Dhamma and the Sangha. It arises with one type of moha-mūla-citta,
 the type that is vicikicchā sampayutta, accompanied by doubt. Doubt
 is completely eradicated by the magga-citta of the sotāpanna.




For the convenience of memorizing, the akusala cetasikas
can be classified in the following categories:

- Mocātuka, the quartet[370](#ftn370) of moha and three other
 cetasikas that are the akusala cetasikas common to all akusala
 cittas, the akusala sādhāraṇā cetasikas. These are: moha, ahirika,
 anottappa and uddhacca. 

- Lotika, the triad[371](#ftn371) of lobha and two other cetasikas
 that can arise together with lobha. This triad is: lobha, diṭṭhi,
 wrong view, and māna, conceit. Diṭṭhi and māna arise with lobha
 cetasika, but diṭṭhi and māna cannot arise at the same time. When
 there is lobha-mūla-citta with diṭṭhi (diṭṭhigata sampayutta), it is
 not accompanied by māna. Māna can accompany the four types of
 lobha-mūla-citta without diṭṭhi (diṭṭhigata vippayutta), but it does
 not always accompany these cittas. Sometimes māna accompanies
 lobha-mūla-citta without diṭṭhi and sometimes not. 

- Docātuka, the quartet of dosa cetasika and three other cetasikas
 that can arise together with dosa. This quartet is: dosa, issā
 (jealousy), macchariya (avarice), and kukkucca (regret). Issā,
 macchariya and kukkucca can accompany the two types of
 dosa-mūla-citta, but these three cetasikas do not arise at the same
 time and they do not always accompany dosa-mūla-citta. Sometimes
 they accompany dosa-mūla-citta, sometimes they don’t. 

- Thīduka, the dyad[372](#ftn372) of thīna, sloth, and middha,
 torpor. These two cetasikas always arise together, they cannot be
 separated. They can accompany the five types of akusala cittas that
 are sasaṇkhārika, but they do not always accompany these cittas. 

- Vicikicchā, doubt, has not been classified in a specific category.
 Thirteen akusala cetasikas are classified in four categories, and
 thus, together with vicikicchā there are fourteen akusala cetasikas
 in all. 



25 Types of Sobhana Cetasikas:

Sobhana cetasikas are cetasikas that are beautiful,
wholesome. When the citta is accompanied by sobhana cetasikas the citta
is sobhana, beautiful. Akusala cetasikas are quite different from
sobhana cetasikas and they can arise only with the twelve types of
akusala cittas. Sobhana cetasikas accompany kusala citta, sahetuka
kusala vipākacitta or sobhana kiriyacitta. Sobhana cetasikas accompany
kāmāvacara kusala citta (of the sense sphere, mahā-kusala citta),
rūpāvacara kusala citta, arūpāvacara kusala citta, lokuttara kusala
citta; they accompany kāmāvacara sahetuka vipāka (accompanied by sobhana
hetus, mahā-vipāka), rūpāvacara vipākacitta, arūpāvacara vipākacitta,
lokuttara vipākacitta; they accompany kāmāvacara sahetuka kiriyacitta
(mahā-kiriyacitta), rūpāvacara kiriyacitta and arūpāvacara kiriyacitta.


There are different types of sobhana cetasikas
accompanying sobhana cittas: nineteen types accompany each type of
sobhana citta and six types do not.

Nineteen sobhana cetasikas are common to all sobhana
cittas, the sobhana sādhāraṇā cetasikas. With regard to the cetasikas
that do not accompany each sobhana citta, they are the following six
types:

- Abstinences, virati cetasikas, of which there are three types,
 accompanying sixteen types of citta: eight mahā-kusala cittas and
 eight lokuttara cittas (or forty types).[373](#ftn373) 
- Illimitables, appamaññā cetasikas, among which two types
 (compassion and sympathetic joy) can accompany eight types of
 mahā-kusala citta, eight types of mahā-kiriyacitta, four types of
 rūpāvacara kusala citta (not those of the fifth stage of jhāna),
 four types of rūpāvacara vipākacitta and four types of rūpāvacara
 kiriyacitta.[374](#ftn374) 
- Wisdom, paññā cetasika, which accompanies forty-seven cittas:
 twelve types of kāmāvacara cittas called ñāṇa sampayutta,
 accompanied by paññā; twenty-seven types of mahaggata cittas
 (jhānacittas), which are fifteen types of rūpāvacara cittas and
 twelve types of arūpāvacara cittas; and the eight types of lokuttara
 cittas.



19 Types of Sobhana Sādhāraṇā Cetasikas:

1. Confidence or faith, saddhā cetasika, is the cetasika that is
 pure. It is compared with a purifying gem, which makes turbid water
 clean and pure. When confidence arises, akusala dhammas, which are
 compared with mud, subside, they cannot arise. Thus, confidence,
 saddhā, is the reality that is confidence in kusala dhammas. 

2. Mindfulness, sati cetasika, is the cetasika that is mindful,
 non-forgetful of kusala dhammas. When akusala arises in our daily
 life, there is no sati that is mindful of dāna, sīla or bhāvanā
 (mental development). Kusala citta can arise and apply itself to
 dāna, sīla or bhāvanā when there is sati cetasika, which is mindful,
 non-forgetful of these ways of kusala. 

3. Moral shame, hiri cetasika, is the cetasika that is ashamed of and
 shrinks back from akusala dhammas. When kusala citta arises, there
 is shame of akusala dhammas. The characteristic of shame is compared
 to the shrinking back from dirt. 

4. Fear of blame, ottappa cetasika, is the cetasika that fears the
 danger of akusala dhammas. Whenever akusala dhamma, even of a slight
 degree, arises, there is no fear of the danger of that dhamma. The
 characteristic of fear of blame is compared to fear of touching a
 lump of hot iron. 

5. Non-attachment, alobha cetasika, is the cetasika that does not
 cling to the object, which is detached from it. When there is
 delight in and clinging to an object, the ways of kusala of dāna,
 sīla or bhāvanā cannot arise. Each kind of kusala citta that arises
 must have alobha cetasika as root, hetu. The characteristic of
 non-attachment is compared to a water drop, which does not cling to
 the petal of a lotus. 

6. Non-aversion, adosa cetasika, is the cetasika that is not angry,
 coarse or harsh. It has the characteristic of friendliness, and it
 is also called mettā (mitto meaning friend), because it extends
 benevolence to all beings. 

7. Equanimity, tatramajjhattatā cetasika, is mental balance,
 evenmindedness, impartiality. It is neutrality (upekkhā) towards the
 object that is experienced. There are ten kinds of Equanimity,
 Upekkhā:[375](#ftn375)
    - Sixfold Upekkhā, chaḷaṅga upekkhā, which is tatramajjhattatā
 cetasika. This is the evenmindedness or neutrality of the arahat
 towards the objects appearing through the six doors. 
    - Equanimity of one of the brahma-vihāras,[376](#ftn376)
 brahma-vihārupekkhā. This is tatramajjhattatā cetasika which is
 evenmindedness towards beings. 
    - Equanimity that is one of the enlightenment factors,
 bhojjhangupekkhā. This is tatramajjhattatā cetasika, which is among
 the enlightenment factors leading to the realization of the four
 noble Truths. 
    - Equanimity of effort, viriyupekkhā. This is viriya cetasika, which
 is right effort, neither over strenuous nor lax in mental
 development. 
    - Equanimity as to conditioned realities, saṅkhārupekkhā. This is
 paññā cetasika which is neutral as it penetrates the three
 characteristics of impermanence, dukkha and anattā of conditioned
 realities, saṅkhāra dhammas. 
    - Equanimity of feeling, vedanupekkhā. This is vedanā cetasika,
 which is indifferent feeling, feeling that is neither unhappy nor
 happy. 
    - Equanimity in vipassanā, vipassanupekkhā. This is paññā cetasika
 which is neutral as it investigates the object that arises because
 of its appropriate conditions. 
    - Equanimity of tatramajjhattatā cetasika, tatramajjhattupekkhā.
 This is tatramajjhattatā cetasika, which effects mental balance,
 which is devoid of deficiency or excess. 
    - Equanimity of jhāna, jhānupekkhā. This is tatramajjhattatā
 cetasika in the development of jhāna, which abandons interest in the
 dhammas distracting from calm and mental steadiness. This kind of
 upekkhā arises with the jhānacitta of the third stage (of the
 fourfold system) and it abandons the jhāna-factor rapture, pīti. 
    - Purifying equanimity, parisuddhupekkhā. This is tatramajjhattatā
 cetasika arising with the jhānacitta of the fourth stage (of the
 fourfold system). It is the condition for calm and purification of
 all that opposes calm. At this stage there are no more jhāna-factors
 to be abandoned. 

8. Tranquility of body, kāya-passaddhi.[377](#ftn377) This is the
 cetasika that is calm, not restless, and it conditions the
 accompanying cetasikas to be calm and not restless. 

9. Tranquility of citta, citta-passaddhi. This is the cetasika that
 conditions the citta it accompanies to be calm. There is no calm
 when one clings to being alone, to silence, to being in the forest,
 to freedom from agitation. Then there is lobha-mūla-citta. There is
 no true calm, freedom from akusala, when one does not apply oneself
 to dāna, sīla or bhāvanā. Bhāvanā includes samatha, the development
 of calm by paññā as well as vipassanā, the development of insight
 wisdom, which knows the true nature of the characteristics of the
 realities that appear. Tranquility of body and tranquility of citta
 are cetasikas that are opposed to restlessness, uddhacca cetasika. 

10. Lightness of body, kāya-lahutā. This is the cetasika that is
 light, buoyant, and it conditions the accompanying cetasikas to be
 light, to be without the sluggishness of akusala. 

11. Lightness of citta, citta-lahutā. This is the cetasika that
 conditions the citta it accompanies to be light, without heaviness.
 Lightness of body and lightness of citta are opposed to sloth and
 torpor, thīna cetasika and middha cetasika. 

12. Pliancy of body, kāya-mudutā. This is the cetasika that is smooth
 and pliant. It conditions the accompanying cetasikas to be without
 rigidity and coarseness. 

13. Pliancy of citta, citta-mudutā. This cetasika conditions the
 citta it accompanies to be smooth, without rigidity. Pliancy of body
 and pliancy of citta are opposed to wrong view, diṭṭhi cetasika, and
 conceit, māna cetasika. 

14. Wieldiness of body, kāya-kammaññatā. This is the cetasika that is
 necessary for the workableness of the sobhana dhammas. It conditions
 the accompanying cetasikas to be suitable for their functioning as
 sobhana dhammas. 

15. Wieldiness of citta, citta-kammaññatā. This is the cetasika which
 conditions the citta it accompanies to be suitable in its
 functioning as sobhana dhamma. Wieldiness of body and wieldiness of
 citta are opposed to the akusala dhammas which cause citta to be
 unwieldy with regard to sobhana dhammas.[378](#ftn378) 

16. Proficiency of body, kāya-pāguññatā. This is the cetasika that is
 skilful and it conditions the accompanying cetasikas to be skilful
 and efficient with regard to the dhammas which are wholesome and
 beautiful. 

17. Proficiency of citta, citta-pāguññatā. This is the cetasika that
 conditions the citta it accompanies to be skilful with regard to the
 dhammas which are wholesome and beautiful. Proficiency of body and
 proficiency of citta are the cetasikas that are opposed to
 diffidence, lack of confidence in wholesomeness. 

18. Uprightness of body, kāya-ujukatā. This is the cetasika that is
 upright, and it conditions the accompanying cetasikas to be
 resolute, without crookedness and sincere in the application of
 wholesomeness. 

19. Uprightness of citta, citta-ujukatā. This is the cetasika that
 conditions the citta it accompanies to be resolute and sincere in
 the application of wholesomeness. Uprightness of body and
 uprightness of citta are opposed to deception and craftiness, which
 cause the citta to be crooked, insincere. 




The aforementioned nineteen types of sobhana cetasikas
accompany each type of sobhana citta. They do not accompany the twelve
types of akusala cittas and the eighteen types of ahetuka cittas, thus,
thirty types of citta. Sobhana cittas are either dvihetuka, accompanied
by two hetus (alobha and adosa) or tihetuka, accompanied by three hetus
(alobha, adosa and amoha or paññā); there are no sobhana cittas with
only one hetu. Whereas akusala cittas are not tihetuka, they can only be
ekahetuka, accompanied by one hetu (moha) or dvihetuka, and in that case
they are accompanied by moha and lobha or by moha and dosa. 

Apart from the nineteen sobhana sadhāraṇā cetasikas, the
cetasikas common to all sobhana cittas, there are six sobhana cetasikas
that do not accompany each sobhana citta. Among them are the three
abstinences, which have as function abstaining from akusala. There is
the following classification of the six sobhana cetasikas that do not
accompany each sobhana citta:

1. Right speech, sammā-vāca, the cetasika that has the function of
 abstaining from the four kinds of unwholesome speech, from lying
 (musāvādo), rough speech (pharusavācā), slandering (pisuṇavācā), and
 idle talk (samphappalāpo). When there is abstention from wrong
 speech, the cetasika that is right speech abstains from wrong
 speech. 

2. Right action, sammā-kammanta, is the cetasika that abstains from
 the three kinds of wrong action, from killing (pāṇātipāto), stealing
 (adinnādānaṃ), and sexual misconduct (kāmesu micchācāro). When there
 is abstention from these three kinds of unwholesome bodily action,
 the cetasika that is right action performs the function of
 abstaining from unwholesome bodily action. 

3. Right livelihood, sammā-ājīva, is the cetasika that abstains from
 wrong livelihood (micchā-ājīva), namely: the three kinds of
 unwholesome bodily action and the four kinds of unwholesome speech
 pertaining to one’s livelihood. When there is abstention from wrong
 livelihood, the cetasika that is right livelihood performs the
 function of abstaining from wrong livelihood. 



Furthermore, there are two “illimitables,” appamaññā
cetasikas, classified among the six sobhana cetasikas that do not
accompany each sobhana citta. They have beings and people as object and
they do not arise with mahā-vipākacitta, the rūpāvacara cittas of the
fifth stage of jhāna, arūpāvacara cittas and lokuttara cittas. They are
classified as follows:

4. Compassion, karuṇā cetasika, the cetasika that has compassion for
 beings who are suffering. It has non-harming as manifestation. 

5. Sympathetic joy, muditā cetasika, the cetasika that rejoices in
 the happiness of another being, and it is opposed to jealousy, issā.
 



There is one more cetasika among the six that do not
accompany each sobhana citta:

6. Paññā cetasika, the cetasika that is right view, right
 understanding of the characteristics of dhammas and right
 understanding of cause and result with regard to realities. 





The nineteen sobhana sādhāraṇā cetasikas accompany all
sobhana cittas, including kusala citta, vipākacitta and kiriyacitta.
They accompany kāmāvacara cittas, rūpāvacara cittas, arūpāvacara cittas
and lokuttara cittas. 

Six sobhana cetasikas do not accompany each sobhana
citta, and there are the following distinctions to be made:

The three abstinences, virati cetasikas, may sometimes
accompany eight mahā-kusala cittas and they always accompany the eight
lokuttara cittas (or the forty lokuttara cittas with jhāna factors). The
abstinences do not accompany each mahā-kusala citta. Only when
mahā-kusala citta is abstaining of a particular kind of akusala kamma is
it accompanied by the relevant virati cetasika. The three abstinences
cannot accompany mahā-kusala citta all at the same time. However, when
lokuttara citta arises, all three abstinences accompany the citta at the
same time. When the magga-citta arises, the three abstinences perform
their function as path-factor while the conditions for wrong conduct are
cut off, in accordance with the stage of enlightenment that is attained.
They also accompany the phala-cittas. Thus, the eight (or forty)
lokuttara cittas must be accompanied by all three abstinences. 

The abstinences do not accompany mahā-kiriyacitta,
because the arahat has completely eradicated all defilements and there
is no need any more for abstention from akusala.

The abstinences do not accompany mahā-vipākacitta. They
arise one at a time with mahā-kusala citta at the actual moment of
abstaining from akusala. Mahā-vipākacitta, which is the result of
mahā-kusala, is not accompanied by the abstinences, it does not perform
the function of abstaining from akusala. 

Mahā-vipāka (kusala vipāka of the sense-sphere) is
different from rūpāvacara vipāka, arūpāvacara vipāka and lokuttara
vipāka, vipākacittas with the same types of cetasikas as the kamma that
produced them. Rūpāvacara kusala citta is kamma-condition,
kamma-paccaya, for rūpāvacara vipākacitta, its result, and this has the
same types of cetasikas and it also experiences the same object as the
rūpāvacara kusala citta that produced it. They are compared to a body
and its reflection, since they are similar. It is the same in the case
of arūpāvacara kusala citta and vipākacitta, and lokuttara kusala citta
and vipākacitta. However, the mahā-kusala citta and its result, the
mahā-vipākacitta, are not accompanied by the same cetasikas. Thus, the
mahā-vipākacitta that is the result of the mahā-kusala citta abstaining
from akusala, is not accompanied by one of the abstinences. 

The abstinences do not accompany rūpāvacara citta and
arūpāvacara citta, because at the moment of mahaggata citta
(jhānacitta), there is no kamma through body or speech and thus there
would be no need to abstain. 

As regards the two illimitables of compassion and
sympathetic joy, classified among the six sobhana cetasikas that do not
accompany each sobhana citta, these do not arise together. They arise
one at a time when citta has as object beings or persons, who experience
suffering (in which case that being is the object of compassion) or
happiness (in which case that being is the object of sympathetic joy).
The illimitables do not accompany mahā-vipākacitta, for the same reason
as in the case of the abstinences. They can accompany, one at a time,
mahā-kusala citta and mahā-kiriyacitta that have beings or persons as
object.

Compassion and sympathetic joy are among the four
“divine abidings,” brahma-vihāras, subjects of calm developed in
samatha: the development of loving-kindness, mettā, which is adosa
cetasika; the development of compassion, karuṇā, which is karuṇā
cetasika; the development of sympathetic joy, muditā, which is muditā
cetasika; the development of equanimity, upekkhā, which is
tatramajjhattatā cetasika. Samatha can be developed with one of the
brahma-vihāras as subject. When mahā-kusala citta is accompanied by
loving-kindness, compassion or sympathetic joy, calm can become strong
and steady, to the degree of access concentration (upacāra samādhi,
which is close to absorption in the object), and absorption
concentration which accompanies the jhānacitta of the first stage. If
calm is developed further, the jhānacitta of the second stage, the third
stage and the fourth stage can successively be attained. With the
development of loving-kindness, compassion and sympathetic joy four
stages of rūpa-jhāna (of the fivefold system) can be attained, not the
fifth stage. The jhānacittas of the four lower stages are accompanied by
pleasant feeling, but the jhānacitta of the fifth stage cannot be
accompanied by pleasant feeling, only by indifferent feeling. Therefore,
only the brahma-vihāra of equanimity can be the object of the jhānacitta
that has been developed to the fifth stage of jhāna. Loving-kindness,
compassion and sympathetic joy can be the meditation subjects of the
jhānacitta of the four lower stages whereas equanimity is the meditation
subject of the jhānacitta of the fifth stage. 

The two illimitables of compassion and sympathetic joy
do not accompany arūpāvacara citta, because this type of citta does not
have beings and persons as object. Neither do they accompany lokuttara
citta because this has nibbāna as object. 

Paññā cetasika arises with all kāmāvacara cittas that
are ñāṇa-sampayutta, accompanied by paññā. It arises also with
rūpāvacara cittas, arūpāvacara cittas and lokuttara cittas, which cannot
arise without paññā. 

Thus, we see that kāmāvacara kusala citta is always
accompanied by the sobhana sādhāraṇā cetasikas. Sometimes it is
accompanied by one of the abstinences when it abstains from akusala,
sometimes it is accompanied by one of the two illimitables of compassion
and sympathetic joy, and sometimes it is accompanied by paññā cetasika.
When one develops samatha or vipassanā, there is mahā-kusala citta
ñāṇa-sampayutta, accompanied by paññā cetasika.
