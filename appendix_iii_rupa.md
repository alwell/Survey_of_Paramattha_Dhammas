## Appendix III: Rūpa

28 Types of Rūpa

Rūpa is the paramattha dhamma that does not know
anything. Rūpa is sankhata dhamma, conditioned dhamma, dhamma that
arises and falls away. There must be the appropriate conditions for the
arising of rūpa. The derived rūpas, upādāya rūpas, arise in dependence
on the four Great Elements, the mahā-bhūta rūpas. However, there must be
causes for the arising of both the derived rūpas and the four Great
Elements, and these are the dhammas that are the origination factors of
all rūpas that arise. Rūpas could not arise without these origination
factors. There are four origination factors, samuṭṭhāna, which cause the
arising of rūpas in the body, namely: kamma, citta, temperature (utu)
and nutrition (āhāra). 

Rūpas which originate from kamma are called kammaja
rūpas.[379](#ftn379)

Rūpas which originate from citta are called cittaja
rūpas.

Rūpas which originate from temperature are called utuja
rūpas. 

Rūpas which originate from nutrition are called āhāraja
rūpas. 



Kammaja Rūpa

Rūpas that originate from kamma do not originate from
the other three factors. There are nine kinds of kammaja rūpas:

1. Eyesense, cakkhuppasāda rūpa, 
2. Earsense, sotappasāda rūpa, 
3. Smelling-sense, ghānappasāda rūpa, 
4. Tasting-sense, jivhāppasāda rūpa, 
5. Bodysense, kāyappasāda rūpa, 
6. Femininity, itthibhāva rūpa, 
7. Masculinity, purisabhāva rūpa, 
8. Heart-base, hadaya rūpa, 
9. Life faculty, jīvitindriya rūpa. 



What seems to be alive but does not originate from
akusala kamma or kusala kamma, such as different kinds of vegetation,
does not have kammaja rūpa. 

Some people do not have all kammaja rūpas. They lack
eyesense, earsense, smelling-sense, tasting-sense, bodysense, femininity
or masculinity. However, for living beings in the planes where there are
five khandhas (nāma and rūpa), there must be heart-base, hadaya rūpa, a
base where citta arises, and there must be life faculty, jīvitindriya
rūpa. Jīvitindriya rūpa arises in each group of rūpas, kalāpa,
originated from kamma. 

For beings of the brahma plane who are without
consciousness, asañña satta,[380](#ftn380) there is only rūpa, not nāma.
So long as they are asañña satta brahmas, citta and cetasika do not
arise. There is for them only the kalāpa, group of rūpas, with life
faculty. They do not have the rūpas that are the senses, sex or
heart-base. 

The nine types of kammaja rūpas are derived rūpas,
upādāya rūpas, which have to arise together with the eight inseparable
rūpas, avinibbhoga rūpas.[381](#ftn381) There are the following groups
or kalāpas originated from kamma:

1. The decad of the eyesense, cakkhudasaka[382](#ftn382) kalāpa,
 consisting of the eight inseparable rūpas, eyesense and life
 faculty. 
2. The decad of earsense, sotadasaka kalāpa, consisting of the eight
 inseparable rūpas, earsense and life faculty. 
3. The decad of smelling-sense, ghānadasaka kalāpa, consisting of the
 eight inseparable rūpas, smelling-sense and life faculty. 
4. The decad of tasting-sense, jivhādasaka kalāpa, consisting of the
 eight inseparable rūpas, tasting-sense and life faculty. 
5. The decad of bodysense, kāyadasaka kalāpa, consisting of the eight
 inseparable rūpas, bodysense and life faculty. 
6. The decad of femininity, itthibhāvadasaka kalāpa, consisting of
 the eight inseparable rūpas, femininity and life faculty. 
7. The decad of masculinity, purisabhāvadasaka kalāpa, consisting of
 the eight inseparable rūpas, masculinity and life faculty. 
8. The decad of heart-base, hadayadasaka kalāpa, consisting of the
 eight inseparable rūpas, heart-base and life faculty. 
9. The vital nonad, jīvitanavaka[383](#ftn383) kalāpa, consisting of
 the eight inseparable rūpas and life faculty. 



Groups of rūpa originated from kamma arise at the
arising moment, the uppāda khaṇa, of the rebirth-consciousness,
paṭisandhi-citta, in accordance with the plane of existence where one is
born. Kamma produces rūpa at the three moments of each citta, namely, at
the arising moment, uppāda khaṇa, the moment of presence, tiṭṭhi khaṇa,
and the moment of falling away, bhanga khaṇa.[384](#ftn384) Kamma ceases
to produce rūpa shortly before death, that is to say, from the
seventeenth moment of citta reckoned backward from the
dying-consciousness. Thus, all kammajarūpa falls away together with the
dying-consciousness, cuti-citta, at the end of a lifespan.[385](#ftn385)

For those who are born by way of the womb, in the human
plane of existence, there are three kalāpas of kammajarūpa, groups of
rūpa originated from kamma, arising together with the
rebirth-consciousness. These three kalāpas are: the decad of heart-base,
the decad of bodysense and the decad of sex. As the newborn being
develops, the kalāpas that are the decads of the eyesense, the earsense,
the smelling-sense and the tasting-sense arise at the appropriate time.


For those who have a spontaneous birth (opapātika),
without the instrumentality of parents,[386](#ftn386) namely, heavenly
beings (devas), petas (ghosts), demons (asurakāyas) and beings born in
hell planes, there are immediately all seven decads of kammajarūpa .
Thus, they have a complete body with the decads of heart-base, bodysense
and sex, and in addition the decads of eyesense, earsense,
smelling-sense and tasting-sense. However, it may happen that kamma does
not condition the arising of specific rūpas, and then these rūpas are
lacking at the time of birth (paṭisandhi kāla) as well as in the course
of life (pavatti kāla). 

For those who have a spontaneous birth in a rūpa-brahma
plane, there are only four kalāpas of kammaja rūpa: the decads of
heart-base, eyesense, earsense and the vital nonad (the kalāpa with life
faculty). There are no smelling-sense, tasting-sense, bodysense and sex.
This is the result of the subduing of clinging to sense objects by the
strength of the jhānacitta that conditioned birth as a being in a
rūpa-brahma plane. 

For those who are asañña satta brahmas, who have only
rūpa, not nāma, there is one kalāpa of kammaja rūpas, the vital nonad.
Someone who is born as an asañña satta brahma has developed the fifth
stage of jhāna and abandoned attachment to nāma. He has seen the danger
of nāma, because so long as there is nāma, one may be involved in
defilements; therefore he wished to be without nāma. If someone’s skill
in the jhāna of the fifth stage does not decline and kusala jhānacitta
of the fifth stage arises shortly before the dying-consciousness, and he
turns away from nāma dhamma, the jhānacitta conditions rebirth with only
rūpa (rūpa paṭisandhi) in the brahma-plane of the asañña satta, where he
will be for five hundred kappas. Since nāma dhamma does not arise, he
cannot move at all. In whatever posture he died before his rebirth as
asaññā satta, in that posture he is reborn until he passes away from
that plane. Then, kusala kamma can condition the arising of
rebirth-consciousness and kammajarūpa in a happy sensuous plane. So
long as defilements have not been eradicated, one will go around in the
cycle of defilements, of kamma and of vipāka. 



Cittaja Rūpa

There are six kalāpas of rūpa originated from citta:

1. The pure octad, suddhatthaka[387](#ftn387) kalāpa, a group of
 eight rūpas consisting of only the eight inseparable rūpas
 (avinibbhoga rūpas). Cittajarūpa which is a pure octad is produced
 at the arising moment (uppāda khaṇa) of the first bhavanga-citta,
 and also after that, throughout life, it is produced at the arising
 moment of citta. However, the five pairs of sense-cognitions do not
 produce any rūpa, they are too weak to produce rūpa. 
2. The nonad of bodily intimation, kāya-viññatti, a kalāpa of nine
 rūpas, which are the eight inseparable rūpas and bodily intimation.
 The citta that by means of rūpa conveys a specific meaning produces
 at its arising moment this kalāpa. 
3. The decad of speech intimation, vāci-viññatti, a kalāpa of ten
 rūpas, which are the eight inseparable rūpas, speech intimation and
 sound, sadda rūpa. The citta that originates speech sound produces
 at its arising moment this kalāpa. 
4. The undecad of lightness, lahutā, a kalāpa of eleven rūpas which
 are the eight inseparable rūpas and the three vikāra rūpas, the
 rūpas of changeability, namely: lightness, lahutā, plasticity,
 mudutā, and wieldiness, kammaññatā. The citta that wants to assume
 different postures produces at its arising moment this kalāpa. 
5. The dodecad of bodily intimation and lightness, a kalāpa of twelve
 rūpas, which are the eight inseparable rūpas, the three vikāra
 rūpas, and bodily intimation. The citta that wants by way of bodily
 expression or different gestures to convey a specific meaning
 produces at its arising moment this kalāpa. 
6. The tridecad of speech intimation, sound and lightness, a kalāpa
 of thirteen rūpas which are the eight inseparable rūpas, the three
 vikāra rūpas, speech intimation and sound. The citta that wants the
 utterance of a specific sound produces at its arising moment this
 kalāpa. That sound arises in dependence on the vikāra rūpas at the
 rūpa which is the base of that sound.[388](#ftn388) 



Each kalāpa of cittajarūpa is produced by citta at its
arising moment (uppāda khaṇa), not at the moment of its presence (tiṭṭhi
khaṇa) nor at the moment of its falling away (bhanga khaṇa).

There are sixteen cittas in all that do not produce
cittajarūpa : four types of arūpa-jhāna vipākacittas, the
rebirth-consciousness, the five pairs of sense-cognitions, and the
dying-consciousness of the arahat.

The four types of arūpa-jhāna vipākacittas do not
produce any rūpa, because they are the results of arūpa-jhāna kusala
citta that sees the disadvantage of rūpa, the dhamma bound up with
defilements. Someone who sees the danger and disadvantage of rūpa
develops arūpa-jhāna kusala, which does not have an object, connected
with materiality. When the arūpa-jhāna vipākacitta performs the function
of rebirth in one of the arūpa-jhāna planes, there is no condition at
all for the arising of any rūpa. 

The rebirth-consciousness does not produce cittajarūpa ,
because it is the first citta in a plane of existence and therefore, it
does not have enough strength for the origination of cittajarūpa . 

The dying-consciousness of the arahat does not produce
rūpa because it is the last citta of the cycle of birth and death, and
thus, there are no longer conditions for the arising of rūpa. 



Utuja Rūpa

There are four kalāpas of rūpa that originate from utu,
temperature, which is the element of heat: 

1. The pure octad, which is a kalāpa consisting of only the eight
 inseparable rūpas. As we have seen, kamma produces in a living being
 rūpa from the moment the rebirth-consciousness arises; it produces
 rūpa at all three moments of citta: at its arising moment, at the
 moment of its presence and at the moment of its falling away. At the
 moment of presence (tiṭṭhi khaṇa) of the rebirth-consciousness, utu,
 that is the element of heat, present in the kalāpa of rūpas produced
 by kamma at the arising moment of the rebirth-consciousness, can in
 its turn produce new rūpas. Utu that is present, after it has
 arisen, originates a pure octad, the eight inseparable rūpas, and
 from that moment on utu originates at the moment of its presence
 other rūpas.[389](#ftn389) 
2. The sound nonad, which is a kalāpa of nine rūpas: the eight
 inseparable rūpas and sound. If sound does not originate from citta,
 in the case of speech intimation, sound originates from temperature,
 such as the sound of traffic, or of a waterfall. 
3. The undecad of lightness, which is a kalāpa of eleven rūpas: the
 eight inseparable rūpas and the three vikāra rūpas. Temperature is
 one of the factors that causes rūpa to be light, soft and workable.
 If utu is not balanced, that is, the right temperature, there will
 be sickness. Even if citta intends to originate rūpa in order to
 move the limbs, it cannot do so if there are no vikāra rūpas
 conditioned by the right temperature. 
4. The dodecad of sound and lightness, which is a kalāpa consisting
 of twelve rūpas: the eight inseparable rūpas, the three vikāra rūpas
 and sound. When there is sound by snapping the fingers or
 applauding, there are the vikāra rūpas arising together with sound.
 



Āhāraja Rūpa

Āhāraja rūpa is rūpa originated from ojā rūpa, nutritive
essence present in food consisting of morsels that can be swallowed
(kabaliṅkāra[390](#ftn390) āhāra). The kalāpas of āhāraja rūpa arise
only in the body of living beings. There are two kalāpas of āhāraja
rūpa:

1. The pure octad, consisting of only the eight inseparable rūpas.
2. The undecad with lightness, lahutā, a kalāpa of eleven rūpas,
 which are the eight inseparable rūpas and the three vikāra rūpas.
 Apart from citta and temperature that produce the three vikāra
 rūpas, also nutrition produces these rūpas. Even if utu, which
 originates the vikāra rūpas, is of the right temperature, but food
 is lacking, the vikāra rūpas do not have enough strength to enable
 someone to move his limbs with ease and swiftness.



Āhāraja rūpa can arise when the nutritive essence
present in morsel food has been absorbed, and at the moment of its
presence ojā rūpa can produce other rūpas.[391](#ftn391) 




Summary of the Rūpas originating from

one of the four factors:

The 8 inseparable rūpas originate from the 4 factors:
some kalāpas originate from kamma, some from citta, some from
temperature and some from nutrition.

The 5 pasāda rūpas, senses, originate from kamma.

The 2 bhāva-rūpas, sex, originate from kamma.

The heart-base, hadaya rūpa, originates from kamma.

The life faculty, jīvitindriya rūpa, originates from
kamma.

The 3 vikāra rūpas, rūpas of changeability, originate
from 3 factors: some kalāpas originate from citta, some from temperature
and some from nutrition. 

The 2 rūpas that are intimation, viññatti rūpas,
originate only from citta.

Sound, sadda rūpa, can originate from 2 factors: some
kalāpas originate from citta and some from temperature.

Pariccheda rūpa or space (akāsa), which delimits
kalāpas, originates from 4 factors: it originates from kamma when it
separates kalāpas originated from kamma; in the same way it originates
from citta, from temperature or from nutrition when it separates the
kalāpas originated from citta, temperature or nutrition. 

The 4 lakkhaṇa rūpas (origination, continuity, decay and
falling away, characteristics inherent in all rūpas) do not originate
from any of the 4 factors, because they are only characteristics of the
18 sabhāva rūpas.[392](#ftn392)
