## Citta Knows an Object

As we read in the “Atthasālinī”, in the section about
the aspects of citta (I, Book I, Part II, § 63), citta is so called
because it thinks of its object, it clearly cognizes its object. We then
read:

“Or, inasmuch as this word citta is common to all states or classes of
citta, that which is known as mundane (lokiya)[^108]: kusala
(wholesome), akusala (unwholesome), or mahā-kiriya,[^109] is
termed ‘citta’, because it arranges itself (cināti) in its own series or
continuity by way of javana (impulsion), in a process of citta. And the
vipāka is also termed ‘citta’ because it is conditioned by accumulated
(cita)[^110] kamma and the defilements.

Moreover, all (four classes)[^111] are termed citta because they
are variegated (citra or vicitta) according to circumstance. The meaning
of citta may also be understood from its capacity of producing a variety
or diversity of effects.”

When we study the texts that have been composed later on
we shall find that they deal with six characteristics of citta. These
aspects are actually taken from the “Atthasālinī”, which is the
commentary to the “Dhammasangaṇi” (“Buddhist Psychological Ethics”), the
first Book of the “Abhidhamma”. The aspects of citta can be classified
as five or six categories:

1. Citta is so called because it thinks (cinteti)[^112] of an
 object, it clearly knows an object.
2. Citta is so called because it arranges itself in its own series or
 continuity, by way of javana in a process.[^113]
3. Citta is so called because it is result (vipāka), conditioned by
 accumulated (cita) kamma and defilements.
4. Citta is so called because it is variegated (vicitta), according
 to circumstances. In the commentaries composed later on this aspect
 has been given as twofold:
 - Citta is variegated because it experiences different objects.
 - Citta is variegated because of the accompanying cetasikas,
 sampayutta dhammas.
5. Citta is so called because of its capacity of producing a
 diversity of effects.

All these aspects will be dealt with systematically, so that the
characteristic of citta will be understood in conformity with the
explanation of the “Atthasālinī”.

Citta is so called because it thinks (cinteti) of its
object, it clearly cognizes its object. All of us think time and again.
If we notice that we are thinking and carefully investigate this, we
shall see that we are really quite occupied with thinking, that we think
for a long time of a variety of things. We cannot prevent thinking – it
goes on and on. Therefore, some people do not want to think; they want
to be calm. They believe that it is beneficial to prevent thinking
because they see that when they are thinking, they have worry and
anxiety; they are restless and disturbed because of attachment or
aversion. 

We should know that citta is actually the reality that
thinks. Rūpa cannot think. When we consider what the subjects are that
citta thinks about, we shall know why citta thinks about them, even
though we sometimes do not like to think about them at all. It is quite
natural that citta arises and thinks time and again about what appears
through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the bodysense and the
mind-door. We believe that all the subjects citta thinks about are very
serious and important, but thinking only occurs because citta arises and
thinks of an object, and then it falls away. If citta would not think
about all those things we take very seriously, they would not exist at
all. As we read in the “Atthasālinī”, citta is so called because it
thinks, it clearly cognizes an object.

As to the dhammas that experience an object, there are
different types of realities, each with its own characteristic, which
experience an object. Cetasika is a reality that experiences an object,
but it is not the “leader” in cognizing an object. Cetasikas arise
together with the citta and they experience the same object as the
citta, but they each perform their own function. Phassa cetasika
(contact), for example, arises together with the citta, but it performs
its own function, it experiences the object by contacting it. If phassa
cetasika did not arise and perform its function while experiencing an
object, there would be no contact with the object. Phassa cetasika
experiences the object only in contacting it, but it does not know the
object in the same way as citta that clearly cognizes the object. 

Paññā is another cetasika that knows, for example, the
characteristics of realities that appear as non-self, not a living
being, not a person. It penetrates the true characteristics of realities
that appear through the six doors. As regards citta, this is the reality
that clearly knows its object, as has already been explained. However,
citta knows the object differently from phassa, which just contacts the
object, or saññā (perception, or remembrance) which recognizes the
characteristic of the object, or paññā, which penetrates the true nature
of realities. 

Citta is the reality that cognizes, that clearly knows
the different characteristics of the objects that appear. Is what is
appearing through the eyes at this moment one and the same colour, or
are there different colours appearing? Reality is true dhamma (sacca
dhamma); it can be verified. We should find out whether at this moment
we see only one thing, only one colour, or whether we see that which is
appearing as different colours, in a detailed way, so that we can
distinguish between different things that are perceived. Can we, for
example, distinguish between a real diamond and a synthetic diamond? 

Citta is the reality that sees and knows clearly; it
clearly knows the different characteristics of the different objects,
and that even into the smallest details. At this moment, the rūpa that
is the eyesense has as its characteristic a special clarity – it can be
compared to a mirror in which the image of whatever passes is clearly
reflected. The eyesense can come into contact with visible object. The
earsense can come into contact just with sound, smelling-sense just with
odour, tasting-sense just with flavour, and bodysense just with those
rūpas that are tangible object. 

Whatever colour appears, the colour of a real diamond,
of a synthetic diamond, of jade, of a stone, even the colour of the look
in someone’s eyes that expresses envy, all that can appear to the citta
which sees.

What appears at this moment through the eyes appears to
citta, which clearly knows it. It sees all the colours of the different
objects that appear, and thus the meaning of things can be known, the
shape and form perceived, and there can be thinking about what has
appeared through the eyes. 

Are sounds that appear through the earsense entirely the
same or are there different sounds? Each sound is different depending on
the conditions that caused the arising of that sound. No matter how many
people there are, the sound of each individual is different. Citta
clearly knows each of the different sounds that appear. Citta knows the
sound of ridicule, of sarcasm, of contempt, of a fan, of a waterfall,
the cry of an animal, the different calls of various kinds of animals,
or even the sound of a man who imitates the sound of an animal. Citta
clearly knows the characteristics of the different sounds; it hears each
different sound. 

All kinds of realities can appear when citta arises and
clearly knows the object that presents itself. The citta that smells
through the nose can arise and clearly know the different odours that
appear. It can clearly know the smell of different kinds of animals,
plants or flowers, the smell of food, of curry and of sweets. Even if we
only smell without seeing anything, we can know what kind of smell it
is.

The citta that experiences flavour through the tongue
can arise and clearly know different flavours. There are many flavours
of food, such as flavour of meat, vegetable or fruit, there is the
flavour of tea, coffee, salt, sugar, orange juice, lemon or tamarind.
All these flavours are completely different, but the citta that tastes
clearly knows each of the different flavours that appear. Citta is able
to distinguish clearly the subtlest differences in flavour, it knows
them in a detailed way. For example, when we sample food, the citta that
tastes the flavour knows exactly whether there is still something
lacking. It knows which ingredient should be added, how the food should
be seasoned so that it is more tasty.

The citta that experiences tangible object impinging on
the bodysense clearly knows the different characteristic of tangible
object. It knows, for example, the characteristic of cold of the air,
cold of the water, or of the cold weather. It knows the characteristic
of silk or of wool that touches the bodysense.

Someone said that while he was standing on the road
there was mindfulness of the characteristic of hardness that appeared.
He thought that this was hardness of the road, that hardness of his
shoes and that hardness of his stockings. All this is thinking about the
characteristic of hardness that appears. The citta that thinks arises
because of conditions. When hardness impinges on the bodysense and one
thinks about what this hardness is, the road, the shoes or the
stockings, it can be known that nobody can avoid thinking of different
things. However, paññā should understand that citta arises, knows
clearly one object at a time and then falls away very rapidly. In this
way, the characteristics of realities can be known as they are. Thinking
about the road, the shoes or the stockings does not occur at the same
time as realizing the characteristic of hardness.

If we clearly understand that it is not a self who
thinks, that it is citta that knows the subject about which it thinks,
it can be a condition for paññā to develop, so that it comes to know
precisely the characteristics of realities as they are. The citta that
thinks is different from the citta that sees. The citta that sees knows
an object through the eyesense, whereas the citta that thinks knows an
object through the mind-door. When a reality appears through the
bodysense, be it the characteristic of softness or hardness, it is
natural that at that moment we do not yet know what it is that is
impinging on the bodysense. Later on we will know what the object is
that is hard or soft. If we touch something in the dark, we may turn on
the light in order to see what we are touching. Thus, we can understand
that at the moment citta experiences hardness, it does not think; that
kind of thinking is another type of citta. 

When citta experiences just hardness, there is no world
of the road, the shoes or the stockings. There is no world of
conventional truth, of concepts. There is only the reality that
experiences the characteristic of hardness. The reality that experiences
hardness is not a living being or a person, it is

just a type of nāma that arises and then falls away. The citta that
arises later on can think about what has appeared through the eyes, the
ears, the nose, the tongue, the bodysense or the mind-door. It thinks
about a story, about concepts of what has appeared. Since we are so
occupied with our thinking, we forget that the citta that arose and
experienced hardness, and the rūpa that is hardness, have fallen away
already.

Also, the cittas that are thinking about the hard
substance, fall away immediately as well. Nāma and rūpa arise and fall
away. Cittas arise and fall away, one after another, continuously, as do
rūpas. This happens so rapidly that we do not realize their arising and
falling away. We do not realize that the nāma dhammas and rūpa dhammas
that arise and fall away are non-self. 

Citta is the reality that clearly knows the object that
appears, be it through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the
bodysense or the mind-door. Whatever object phassa cetasika contacts,
the citta that arises together with it clearly knows the characteristic
of that object; it knows each different object. When it is said of
citta, the reality that experiences something, that it has the
characteristic of clearly knowing an object, we should understand what
that means. It means that citta knows the different characteristics of
the different objects appearing through the senses or through the
mind-door. Citta is the reality that clearly knows an object, and the
object is a condition for citta to arise and to experience that object.
The object is object-condition (ārammaṇa-paccaya), it is a condition for
the arising of citta by being its object. 

Citta cannot arise without knowing an object, but
besides object-condition there are also several other conditions for
each type of citta that arises.
