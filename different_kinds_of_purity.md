## Different Kinds of Purity



Paññā developed in satipaṭṭhāna becomes keener and purer
as successive stages of vipassanā are reached. In the development of
satipaṭṭhāna there are different kinds of purity, visuddhi, and these
can be classified as sevenfold.

The first purity is purity of sīla, sīla visuddhi. Sīla
arising together with satipaṭṭhāna that is aware of the characteristics
of nāma and rūpa is sīla visuddhi. At that moment, there is purification
from ignorance about the characteristics of paramattha dhammas that are
non-self. When satipaṭṭhāna does not arise, one is bound to take sīla
for self, and, thus, sīla is not sīla visuddhi. 

The second purity is purity of citta, citta visuddhi.
This is actually different degrees of samādhi, concentration. When sati
is aware of the characteristics of nāma and rūpa and when jhānacitta is
the object of satipaṭṭhāna, jhānacitta is citta visuddhi. At that
moment, one does not take jhānacitta for self.

The third purity is purity of view, diṭṭhi visuddhi.
This is the stage of insight that is nāma-rūpa-pariccheda-ñāṇa, the
paññā that clearly discerns the difference between the characteristics
of nāma and rūpa. At that moment, one does not take any reality,
including insight knowledge, for self. There is purity of view, diṭṭhi
visuddhi, because there was never before such clear realization of the
different characteristics of nāma and rūpa as non-self.

The fourth purity is purity by overcoming doubt,
kaṅkhāvitaraṇa visuddhi.[^305] 

When purity of view has arisen, paññā developed through
satipaṭṭhāna sees the characteristics of dhammas as they really
are.[^306] Paññā sees realities as they are while sati is aware
of the characteristics of realities as they appear through the eyes, the
ears, the nose, the tongue, the body-sense and the mind-door. In that
way, paññā becomes accomplished to the degree that the second stage of
insight can arise: Knowledge of discerning conditions of nāma and rūpa,
paccaya-pariggaha-ñāṇa. When one directly understands that realities
arise because of their appropriate conditions, doubt about their
conditional arising is eliminated. Then there is the purity by
overcoming doubt.

The fifth purity is purity by knowledge and vision of
what is the path and what is not the path, maggāmagga-ñāṇadassana
visuddhi.[^307]

When purity by overcoming doubt has arisen, paññā
becomes more accomplished through satipaṭṭhāna, which is aware of the
characteristics of nāma and rūpa. Paññā becomes more familiar with their
characteristics and comes to know them more clearly. Paññā realizes that
realities are equal in the sense that all of them are only conditioned
dhammas, and thus there is more equanimity with regard to them. This
means that there is more detachment, less inclination to cling to any
particular nāma or rūpa. Paññā is more inclined to investigate the
arising and falling away of the nāma and rūpa which appear, their
characteristics of impermanence, dukkha and anattā. Thus, paññā can
realize the arising and falling away of dhammas in succession, at the
stage of insight which is comprehension by groups, sammasana ñāṇa. After
that stage there can be the fourth stage of insight that is Knowledge of
the arising and falling away of realities, udayabbaya ñāṇa. This is a
more precise knowledge of the arising and falling away of one kind of
nāma and one kind of rūpa at a time. 

After the fourth stage of insight has fallen away,
defilements can arise. Since they have not been eradicated, they can
condition the arising of one or more “imperfections of insight,”
vipassanūpakkilesas (“Visuddhimagga” Ch XX, 105-129). There are ten
imperfections of insight, arising on account of the following factors: 

- illumination, obhāsa, 
- insight knowledge, vipassanā ñāṇa, 
- rapture, pīti, 
- tranquility, passaddhi, 
- happiness, sukha, 
- resolution, adhimokkha, 
- exertion, paggāha, 
- assurance, upaṭṭhāna, 
- equanimity, upekkhā, 
- delight, nikanti.


As to the first imperfection arising on account of
illumination, this can occur when the fourth stage of insight, Knowledge
of the arising and falling away of nāma and rūpa, has fallen away. The
citta may have reached such a degree of calm that it conditions the
arising of illumination.[^308] When attachment to this arises,
it is an imperfection of insight. This imperfection causes the
interruption of the development of insight. One does not investigate the
arising and falling away of realities anymore and does not attend to
their characteristics of impermanence, dukkha and anattā. 

The second imperfection is attachment to paññā that
clearly realizes the characteristics of nāma and rūpa as they arise and
fall away very rapidly. One is attached to the knowledge that is keen
and that arises in him like a lightning flash. Due to this imperfection,
one does not continue to investigate the arising and falling away of
realities and to develop understanding of the three general
characteristics. 

The third imperfection is attachment to rapture and
satisfaction about the direct understanding of the arising and falling
away of dhammas. 

The fourth imperfection is attachment to tranquillity,
to freedom from restlessness, heaviness, rigidity, crookedness or
unwieldiness.

The fifth imperfection is attachment to the happy
feeling which is very intense and which arises owing to insight.

The sixth imperfection is clinging to the resolution,
steadfastness and strong confidence that arise due to insight.

The seventh imperfection is clinging to well-exerted
energy which is neither too strained nor too lax, and which arises due
to insight.

The eighth imperfection is clinging to well-established
mindfulness and assurance that arises in association with insight. 

The ninth imperfection is clinging to equanimity and
impartiality towards all conditioned dhammas, which occurs in
association with insight. One may cling when paññā is as keen and fast
as a flash of lightning while it realizes the arising and falling away
of the objects that appear. 

The tenth imperfection of insight occurs when someone
delights in insight that clearly realizes the characteristics of nāma
and rūpa as they are. 

When paññā has become keener, it realizes the intricacy
and subtlety of the imperfections of vipassanā and it knows that these
must be eliminated. Paññā realizes that, so long as they arise, the
right Path leading to elimination of even the more subtle attachment to
realities is not developed. That is purity by knowledge and vision of
what is the path and what is not the path,
maggāmagga-ñāṇadassana-visuddhi. Then there can be insight knowledge of
the fourth stage, Knowledge of the arising and falling away of nāma and
rūpa, while the person who develops insight is now free from the
imperfections of insight.[^309] 

The sixth purity is purity by knowledge and vision of
the path, paṭipadā-ñāṇadassana-visuddhi.[^310]

When the imperfections of insight have been overcome,
paññā becomes more accomplished as the development of satipaṭṭhāna
continues, and then there is purity by knowledge and vision of the path.
While the person who develops insight is now free from the imperfections
of insight, there is this purity from the fourth stage of insight on,
which is Knowledge of the arising and falling away of realities, and it
continues up to Adaptation knowledge, anuloma ñāṇa. Adaptation knowledge
are the three moments of citta arising in the magga-vīthi: parikamma or
preparatory citta, upacāra or access and anuloma or adaptation. 

The seventh purity is purity by knowledge and vision,
ñāṇadassana-visuddhi.[^311]

When the three moments of Adaptation knowledge have
fallen away, Change-of-lineage knowledge, gotrabhū ñāṇa, arises. It has
the characteristic of adverting to lokuttara citta, and it neither
belongs to the sixth purity, purity by knowledge and vision of the path,
nor to the seventh purity, purity by knowledge and vision; it is
intermediate between these two kinds of purities. Still, it is reckoned
as insight knowledge, because it follows the course of insight (Vis.
XXII, 1). When change-of-lineage has fallen away, magga-citta arises and
then there is purity by knowledge and vision. Thus, there are seven
purities in all.
