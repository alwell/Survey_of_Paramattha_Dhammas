## Feelings

Cittas are variegated because of different sampayutta
dhammas, the accompanying cetasikas. Cittas can be classified by way of
the different accompanying feelings:

- cittas accompanied by pleasant feeling, somanassa
 sahagata;[188](#ftn188) 
- cittas accompanied by unpleasant feeling, domanassa sahagata; 
- cittas accompanied by indifferent feeling (neither pleasant nor
 unpleasant), upekkhā sahagata; 
- citta accompanied by bodily pleasant feeling, sukha sahagata; 
- citta accompanied by (bodily) painful feeling, dukkha sahagata.



Every citta that arises is accompanied by the cetasika
that is feeling, vedanā. The different cittas are accompanied by
specific feelings, depending on the type of citta. Citta is the “leader”
in knowing the different characteristics of objects and cetasika is the
dhamma which feels on account of the object that is experienced; it can
be happy feeling, unhappy feeling, pleasant bodily feeling, painful
feeling or indifferent feeling. 

Citta is different according to its jāti, that is
kusala, akusala, vipāka or kiriya, and the accompanying cetasikas, are
of the same jāti as the citta. Akusala cetasikas cannot accompany kusala
citta, vipākacitta or kiriyacitta. Kusala cetasikas cannot accompany
akusala citta, vipākacitta or kiriyacitta. Vipāka cetasikas cannot
accompany akusala citta, kusala citta or kiriyacitta. Just as in the
case of the other cetasikas, feeling is varied as it accompanies cittas
of the different jātis of kusala, akusala, vipāka or kiriya. 

If the Buddha had not explained in detail the
characteristics of all kinds of dhammas, people would continue to have
wrong understanding about vedanā cetasika, feeling. For example, painful
feeling that is experienced when one has discomfort, sickness or pain,
arises together with body-consciousness, the vipākacitta, which
experiences tangible object through the bodysense just for one short
moment. This feeling is not the same as (mental) unpleasant feeling,
domanassa, arising when one is annoyed about an unpleasant object that
impinges on the bodysense. Cittas are varied as they are accompanied by
different feelings. The Buddha taught in detail which kind of feeling
accompanies each kind of akusala citta, kusala citta, vipākacitta and
kiriyacitta, and this is a most intricate subject. 

Whenever we feel pain there is bodily painful feeling
and this is akusala vipāka. However, when we are unhappy, disturbed and
anxious because of that painful feeling, it is not vipāka. At that
moment akusala feeling accompanies akusala citta that is displeased.

When we study the Abhidhamma in detail, we can have
right understanding of vedanā cetasika that accompanies citta. If one
does not study realities, one does not know whether feeling at a
particular moment is kusala, akusala, vipāka or kiriya, and therefore,
one is bound to be infatuated with pleasant mental feeling, pleasant
bodily feeling or indifferent feeling. 

We read in the “Gradual Sayings” (I, Book of the Twos,
Ch VIII, On Characteristics, §7) that the Buddha said:

> “Along with feeling, monks, arise evil, unprofitable dhammas, not
without them. By abandoning just those feelings, those evil,
unprofitable dhammas do not exist.”

Then the same is said about the other nāma-khandhas,
apart from vedanākkhandha, namely: saññākkhandha, saṅkhārakkhandha and
viññāṇa-kkhandha. 

Vedanā cetasika, feeling, is the basis of clinging and
clinging is very persistent. If one does not know the truth about vedanā
cetasika, one cannot abandon the view that feeling is self. 

The understanding of the nature of vedanā cetasika is a
supporting condition for sati to begin to be aware of the characteristic
of feeling. If one does not understand what feeling is, one will not
notice that feeling is reality; that it arises time and again in our
daily life, just like the other dhammas that appear through the
sense-doors and the mind-door. These dhammas can only appear because
citta arises and experiences them, and each citta is accompanied by
feeling. 

We should remember that if there were no feeling on
account of what is seen, heard, smelt, tasted and experienced through
the bodysense, there would not be anxiety and akusala dhamma would not
arise. However, since feeling arises, there is clinging to feeling,
holding on to it. One wants to obtain for oneself things that can
condition pleasant feeling. Thus, akusala dhammas continue to arise, but
one does not notice this. 

All dhammas are anattā; nobody can prevent feeling
cetasika from arising. No matter what type of citta arises, it must be
accompanied by feeling cetasika, which feels on account of the object
that is experienced at that moment. Now, at this very moment, there must
be some kind of feeling, be it indifferent feeling, bodily pleasant
feeling, painful feeling, (mental) pleasant feeling or unpleasant
feeling. The study of the Dhamma is not merely knowledge of names and
numbers. The aim of the study is knowing the characteristics of
realities, thus also of feeling which is arising now. There may not yet
be awareness of the characteristic of the feeling of this moment, but we
should remember that the feeling of this moment is a reality that has
arisen and fallen away already. If one does not know the true
characteristic of feeling, one is bound to take pleasant and painful
bodily feeling, mental pleasant and unpleasant feeling and indifferent
feeling for self. 

If sati is not aware of the characteristic of feeling,
it will not be possible to abandon the wrong view that dhammas are
living beings, persons or self. We all consider feeling as something
very important in life. We all want pleasant feeling, nobody wants to
have unpleasant feeling. Therefore, we strive with all means to have
bodily pleasant feeling or mental pleasant feeling. However, one may not
know that there is at such moments clinging, that one tries to hold on
to feeling which arises because of its own conditions and then falls
away again. 

The Buddha classified feeling cetasika as a separate
khandha, vedanākkhandha, because people attach great importance to
feeling and cling to it. It is a reality people take for self, as a
living being or a person, as being of the greatest value. It is
necessary to listen to the Dhamma and study it evermore in detail, to
consider what one has learnt and to investigate the truth of dhammas in
daily life, so that sati can arise and be aware of the characteristics
of the dhammas that appear. 

Vedanā cetasika can be of the four jātis of kusala,
akusala, vipāka and kiriya. Feeling is a conditioned dhamma, saṅkhāra
dhamma. It arises because of its appropriate conditions. Feeling which
is vipāka arises because of kamma-condition, kamma-paccaya. Feeling
which is kusala, akusala or kiriya is not vipāka, it cannot arise
because of kamma-condition, but it arises because of other conditions.
There are different ways of classifying feeling, but when it is
classified as fivefold,[189](#ftn189) pleasant bodily feeling and
painful feeling are of the jāti that is vipāka, they are the results of
kamma. Kamma that has been performed in the past conditions accordingly
the arising of the feelings that are vipāka, which feel on account of
the objects impinging on the sense-doors and the mind-door.

Seeing-consciousness, which is vipākacitta, is
accompanied by indifferent feeling, which is vipāka cetasika, and also
by other cetasikas. It is the same in the case of hearing-consciousness,
smelling-consciousness and tasting-consciousness. However, it is
different in the case of body-consciousness. Body-consciousness which is
akusala vipāka and which experiences a characteristic of tangible object
impinging on the bodysense, is accompanied by painful feeling.
Body-consciousness that is kusala vipāka is accompanied by pleasant
bodily feeling. 

Nobody can change the conditions for the arising of the
feelings that accompany these different types of citta.
Body-consciousness arises because of kamma-condition. When the Great
Elements (hardness, softness, heat, cold, motion or pressure) that are
pleasant objects (iṭṭhārammaṇa) impinge on the rūpa that is bodysense
(kāyappasāda rūpa), pleasant bodily feeling arises. When the Great
Elements that are unpleasant objects, (aniṭṭhārammaṇa) impinge on the
bodysense, painful bodily feeling arises. The feeling that arises at the
bodysense can only be painful feeling or pleasant bodily feeling, not
indifferent feeling, pleasant (mental) feeling or unpleasant feeling.
The bodily feelings and the mental feelings should be distinguished from
each other. When body-consciousness arises, the accompanying feelings,
pleasant bodily feeling and painful feeling, are of the jāti that is
vipāka, they are results of past kamma. However, when one is disturbed
or anxious, there is unhappy feeling and this is not the result of past
kamma. It arises because it is conditioned by accumulated akusala
dhamma.

Apart from painful and pleasant bodily feeling, which
can only be of the jāti which is vipāka, and unpleasant (mental)
feeling, which can only be of the jāti which is akusala, there are other
kinds of feelings, namely pleasant (mental) feeling and indifferent
feeling. These can be kusala, akusala, vipāka or kiriya. The fact that
there is such a variety of feelings makes it clear to us that realities
can only arise because of their appropriate conditions.

Have we ever been aware of the characteristics of
different feelings? At this moment, feeling arises and falls away. Some
people may have begun to be aware of the characteristics of rūpas
appearing through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue or the
bodysense. Others may be inclined to consider and be aware of
characteristics of nāmas, elements that experience objects, when there
is seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, body-consciousness or thinking.
However, this is not enough. Sati should be aware of the characteristics
of dhammas which are classified as the five khandhas: rūpakkhandha,
vedanākkhandha, saññākkhandha, saṅkhārakkhandha (formations or
activities, the cetasikas other than vedanā and saññā, remembrance) and
viññāṇakkhandha. If sati is not yet aware of these dhammas, defilements
cannot be eradicated. Defilements cannot be eradicated if there is
ignorance of realities, thus, if sati is not aware of the
characteristics of all realities that are appearing.

Is there feeling while we are asleep? Dhamma is a
subject that we should reflect on time and again. The more we
investigate the Dhamma the more shall we gain clear understanding of it.
Therefore, we should consider whether there is feeling cetasika, also
while we are asleep. When we are fast asleep we do not experience any
object of this world. There are no objects appearing through the six
doors. At such moments, we do not think, nor do we dream. What we saw or
heard before, what we liked or thought about does not appear. However,
also when we are fast asleep, there must be cittas arising and falling
away, so long as our life term has not come to an end. These are
bhavanga-cittas, life-continuum, which preserve the continuity in one’s
life as this particular individual. As soon as we wake up the objects of
this world appear, until it is time to go to sleep again.

While we are fast asleep, the bhavanga-cittas that are
arising and falling away in succession are vipākacittas, the result of
past kamma; kamma is the condition for the bhavanga-cittas to arise in
succession and to preserve the continuity in the life of a person.
Therefore, the person who sleeps does not die yet. The four
nāma-khandhas, citta and cetasikas, have to arise together, they cannot
be separated from each other. Each time citta arises there must be
cetasikas that accompany the citta. Feeling arises with every citta. The
feeling cetasika that accompanies bhavanga-citta is vipāka cetasika and
it feels on account of the object that is experienced by the
bhavanga-citta. All the accompanying cetasikas share the same object
with the citta. The function of feeling cetasika is feeling on account
of the object that is experienced by the citta. The object of the
bhavanga-citta is not an object of this world; it is the same object as
experienced shortly before the dying-consciousness of the preceding
life. We do not know this object. Neither do we know the characteristic
of the feeling accompanying the bhavanga-citta. 

When we compare the situation of being asleep with the
situation of being awake, it helps us to see more clearly the conditions
for the experience of objects. The objects of this world can only appear
because there are processes of cittas that experience them through the
six doorways.

We should investigate further what exactly wakes up when
we wake up and what exactly is asleep when we are asleep. Rūpa is the
dhamma that does not know anything, thus, rūpa does not wake up nor does
it sleep. Nāma is the dhamma that experiences an object. When nāma does
not know an object appearing in this world, this state is called “being
asleep.” Also, while we are asleep, there are cittas arising and falling
away in succession, preserving the continuity in one’s life, so long as
one does not pass away.

When we wake up, what is it that wakes up? Citta and
cetasikas wake up, because they arise and experience an object through
the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the bodysense or the
mind-door. Thus, when we experience an object of this world we are
awake. If we reflect on this fact in a more detailed way, it will be a
supporting condition for the development of satipaṭṭhāna. The aim of the
teaching of Dhamma is awareness of the characteristics of realities in
order to know them as they are. The Buddha’s words can encourage us to
have right effort (viriya) for satipaṭṭhāna, the development of right
understanding of the realities of this moment. 

As we have seen, when we wake up, citta and cetasikas
know the objects of this world. We have to consider more deeply what
actually wakes up: citta and cetasikas wake up together. Vipākacitta
arises and sees what appears through the eyes or it experiences what
appears through the ears, the nose, the tongue or the bodysense. No one
can prevent this; it is beyond control. Vipākacitta, which is the result
of kamma, arises, experiences an object and then falls away. It would be
impossible to sleep continuously; kamma causes one’s birth into this
life and it does not condition a person to be asleep his whole life
until he dies. It is kamma which produces eyes, ears, nose, tongue and
bodysense so that there are conditions for the arising of citta which
sees a pleasant object, and this is the result of kusala kamma, or citta
which sees an unpleasant object, and this is the result of akusala
kamma. Citta that hears a pleasant sound is the result of kusala kamma,
and citta that hears an unpleasant sound is the result of akusala kamma.
It is the same with regard to the other doorways.

Thus, vipākacitta and cetasikas that arise wake up and
experience objects through each of the doorways in daily life. Apart
from these types of cittas what else is there? When one has woken up
there are also akusala dhammas, all kinds of defilements which begin to
wake up. When one is asleep there are no akusala cittas, but there are
the latent tendencies of defilements (anusaya kilesas), which lie
dormant in the citta. The defilements that have not been eradicated are
accumulated from one citta to the next citta, since cittas arise and
fall away in succession. Thus, also when one is asleep, the accumulated
defilements are carried on from one moment of bhavangacitta to the next
moment of bhavangacitta. At these moments, defilements do not arise and
there cannot be like or dislike of an object, since one does not see
yet, one does not hear, smell, taste or experience tangible object yet,
one does not experience any object of this world. When we are asleep,
all the defilements are also asleep. However, when we wake up, the
defilements wake up. After seeing, hearing and the experience of the
other sense objects, all kinds of defilements arise with akusala citta,
depending on the conditions that cause the arising of particular akusala
dhammas.

As we have seen, cittas can be classified by way of four
planes, bhūmis, of citta, namely, kāmāvacara bhūmi, rūpāvacara bhūmi,
arūpāvacara bhūmi and lokuttara bhūmi. Cittas are more refined as they
are of higher planes.

Cittas are mostly of the kāmāvacara bhūmi, of the sense sphere; thus,
one experiences visible object, sound, odour, flavour or tangible
object. Kāmāvacara citta is of the plane that is of the lowest grade. As
soon as we wake up we see and hear. Citta turns towards the objects
appearing through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the
bodysense and the mind-door. Citta frequents these sense objects. The
cittas that arise in a day are of the lowest plane and moreover, they
are usually of the most inferior jāti, that is, akusala. Usually it is
akusala citta that wakes up, unless there are conditions for kusala.
When we see, clinging follows seeing most of the time. We hear and then
we are attached to the sound that was heard, and this is natural. Citta
rooted in attachment arises more often than citta rooted in aversion,
the citta that is annoyed and harsh.

We should face the truth that there are more often
akusala cittas than kusala cittas in a day. If we do not realize this,
we cannot develop kusala in order to be free from cittas that are
inferior and mean. Then there will continue to be innumerable akusala
cittas, just as usual. When we do not see the danger and disadvantage of
akusala, we may even enjoy our akusala. Thus, we should remember that it
is usually defilement, kilesa, which wakes up. Defilements arise in the
processes of the eye-door, the ear-door, the nose-door, the tongue-door,
the door of the bodysense and the mind-door. 

It depends on the individual to what extent defilements
will cause suffering of mind and body. When we realize the confusion and
suffering caused by defilements, we shall apply ourselves to the
development of kusala, be it dāna, sīla, samatha or satipaṭṭhāna. When
one develops satipaṭṭhāna, there is awareness of the characteristics of
the realities that are appearing.

Some people believe that they should try to eradicate
lobha first, so that they are able to develop the paññā that leads to
the stage of enlightenment of the sotāpanna. However, this is
impossible. Lobha, attachment, arises, it is a type of reality that
arises because of the appropriate conditions. It is not a being, person
or self. However, paññā should consider the characteristic of lobha so
that it can be known as it is: a type of reality that arises and then
falls away.

The types of feeling arising with different cittas can
be classified as fivefold in the following way:

- pleasant bodily feeling, accompanying body-consciousness that is
 kusala vipāka; 
- painful feeling, accompanying body-consciousness that is akusala
 vipāka; 
- unpleasant feeling, accompanying the two types of dosa-mūla-citta;
- pleasant (mental) feeling, which can accompany cittas that are
 kusala, akusala, vipāka and kiriya;
- indifferent feeling, which can accompany cittas that are kusala,
 akusala, vipāka and kiriya. 



Unpleasant feeling cannot accompany cittas that are
kusala, vipāka and kiriya. It can accompany only akusala citta, namely,
the two types of dosa-mūla-citta, citta rooted in
aversion.[190](#ftn190) If one does not know this, one may take for
kusala what is in fact akusala. This may happen, for example, when one
feels sorry for people who suffer and who are in trouble. One wants to
help them so that they are relieved from their distress. There may be
conditions for kusala citta with true compassion, karuṇā cetasika.
However, one should know the characteristic of the feeling that
accompanies the citta, one should know whether one has unpleasant
feeling or not. When one has unpleasant feeling, when one is sad, there
is akusala citta. Akusala citta is completely different from kusala
citta that is accompanied by compassion, karuṇā cetasika. If one truly
understands this, one can abandon the sad, unhappy feeling that is
akusala. Then one will be able to help someone else to be free from
suffering with feeling that is happy, not unpleasant or sad. 

Therefore, one should know precisely when the citta is
akusala, so that akusala can be eliminated. People usually believe, when
they have compassion for someone who suffers, that they should also take
part in his sadness and unhappiness. They do not realize that this is
not true compassion. 

People are usually ignorant of their feelings. If
someone is asked what feeling he has at this moment, he may only know
vaguely whether he feels indifferent, happy or unhappy. Feeling arises
with each citta, but it is not easy to realize its true nature, even
when there is awareness of feeling. Feeling is only a reality that
experiences, a kind of nāma. When sound appears, the citta that is
hearing-consciousness hears sound. At that moment there is feeling,
vedanā cetasika, which accompanies hearing-consciousness. When the
cetasika that is contact, phassa, contacts the object, vedanā cetasika
must also arise. If sati can begin to be aware of the characteristic of
citta or of feeling, supporting conditions are accumulated for being
less forgetful of realities when we have indifferent feeling, happy
feeling, bodily pleasant feeling, painful feeling or unhappy feeling. We
may be sad, but instead of giving in to unhappy feeling, there can be
sati that is aware of it and then it can be known as only feeling
cetasika arising because of conditions. Thus, we see that satipaṭṭhāna
is beneficial, that right understanding can relieve suffering when one
is distressed and feels unhappy.
