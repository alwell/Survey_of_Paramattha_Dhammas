## General Introduction

We read in the “Kindred Sayings” (I, Sagāthā vagga, The
Devas, Ch 7, §2, Citta sutta) that a deva asked:

```

“Now what is that whereby the world is led?
And what is that whereby it is drawn along?
And what is that above all other things
That brings everything under its sway?”

```
The Buddha answered:

```
“It is citta whereby the world is led,
And by citta it is ever drawn along,
And citta it is above all other things
That brings everything under its sway.”

```
This sutta shows us the power of citta.[98](#ftn98) Citta is an element
that experiences something, a reality that experiences an object. It is
the “chief,” the leader in knowing the object that appears.[99](#ftn99)
There is not only citta that sees, citta that hears, citta that smells,
citta that tastes or citta that experiences tangible object, there is
also citta that thinks about many diverse subjects. The world of each
person is ruled by his citta. The cittas of some people have accumulated
a great deal of wholesomeness (kusala). Even when they meet someone who
is full of defilements they can still have loving-kindness, compassion
or equanimity because of their accumulations of wholesomeness. Whereas
the world of someone else may be a world of hatred, annoyance, anger and
displeasure, according to his accumulations. Thus, in reality, each
person is all the time his own world.

It seems that we are all living together in the same
world. However, in reality all the different rūpas (material phenomena)
that appear through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind,
all those different phenomena, could not appear and be of such
importance if there were no citta, the element that experiences them.
Since citta experiences the objects that appear through the sense-doors
and through the mind-door, the world of each person is ruled by his
citta.

Which world is better: the world where a great deal of
wholesomeness has been accumulated, so that kindness, compassion,
sympathetic joy and equanimity can arise, or the world of hatred, anger
and displeasure? Different people may meet the same person and know the
same things about him, but the world of each one of them will evolve
with loving-kindness or with aversion, depending on the power of the
citta that has accumulated different inclinations in the case of each
person.

Because of visible object, which appears through the
eyes, it seems as if there are many people living together in this
world, at a certain time and in a particular location. However, if there
is clear comprehension of the characteristic of the element that
experiences – the dhamma that arises and sees the object that appears at
that moment – one will know that, while there is seeing just for a short
moment, there is only the world of seeing. Then there are no people,
other living beings or different things. At the moment of seeing,
thinking about shape and form has not yet occurred; thinking of a story
about what is seen has not yet happened.

However, when we think of the world, with its beings,
people or different things, we should know that this is only a moment of
citta that thinks about what appeared to citta that sees, about visible
object. Seeing occurs at a moment different from thinking about what
appears. For everyone, citta arises just for a moment, then it is
succeeded by the next one; this happens continuously. Thus, it seems
that the whole wide world is there, with its many different people and
things. But we should have right understanding of what the world is. We
should know that realities appear one at a time, and that they appear
only for one moment of citta. Since cittas arise and fall away,
succeeding one another very rapidly, it seems that the world does not
disintegrate, the world lasts, with beings, people and many different
things. In reality the world lasts just for one moment, namely, when
citta arises and cognizes an object, just for that moment, and then it
falls away together with the citta. 

In the “Buddhist Psychological Ethics” (the
“Dhammasangaṇi”, Book I, Part I, Ch I, §6) several synonyms for citta
have been given. Citta is called mind (mano or mānasa), heart (hadaya),
“that which is pure”(paṇḍara), mind-base (manāyatana), faculty of mind
(manindriya), consciousness (viññāṇa), the khandha of consciousness
(viññāṇakkhandha), and the element of “mind-consciousness” (mano-viññāṇa
dhātu).[100](#ftn100)

The Buddha used several synonyms for citta so that the
characteristic of citta that is common to everybody could be understood.
Citta is reality, it is an element that experiences something, but it is
difficult to understand what exactly the characteristic is of the
element that experiences. People may more or less understand what citta
is; they know that it is the mind, which is common to everybody, but if
one only knows this and does not really investigate the nature of citta,
one will not know at which moment citta occurs.

The “Atthasālinī”, the commentary to the
“Dhammasangaṇi”, (“Expositor” I, Book I, Part IV, Ch II, 140) states
that the reality that is citta is so called because of its variegated
nature (the Pāli term vicitta means variegated or various). There is not
only one kind of element that experiences, citta, but there are many
different kinds of citta. Citta is variegated. Its variegated nature
appears when we think of different subjects, when we think, for example,
about what we are going to do on a particular day. When we consider this
more, we shall find out that thinking occurs according to the variegated
nature of all the different cittas that arise.

What shall we do today, this afternoon, tomorrow? If
there were no citta we could not perform any action. The fact that we
all can perform different actions in a day is due to the variegated
nature of the cittas of each one of us. We can see that all our actions
in daily life, through body and speech, are different because of the
variegated nature of the cittas of each one of us. When we are thinking,
citta is the reality that thinks, and each person thinks in a different
way. Different people, who are interested in the Dhamma and study it,

consider it and ponder over it in different ways. They also have
different points of view as far as the practice is concerned. The world
evolves in accordance with the variegated nature of the cittas of
different people. The world is constituted by different people living in
different countries and participating in different groups and these
different individuals condition the events in the world. This occurs
because of the variety of the thinking of each individual. The world of
today evolves in this particular way according to the variegated nature
of the cittas of people at this time. How will the world be in the
future? It will be again just according to the variegated nature of the
cittas that think of many different subjects. 

Hence, we see that citta is of a variegated nature. The
citta that sees through the eye-door is one type of citta. It is
different from the citta that hears through the ears, which is another
type of citta. The citta that thinks is again another type of citta. 

The “Atthasālinī” states that citta is called “mind”
(mano), because it determines and knows an object (ārammaṇa or
ālambana). The word object, ārammaṇa, means that which is known by
citta. When citta, the dhamma that experiences, arises, it cognizes what
is called an “object.” 

Sound is a reality. When hard things contact each other,
it is a condition for the arising of sound. However, when the citta that
arises does not experience sound at that moment, sound is not an object.
Anything may arise because of conditions, but if citta does not
experience it, it is not an object, ārammaṇa. 

Citta is named “heart,” hadaya, because it is an inward
reality. Citta is internal because it is a reality that experiences the
object that appears. The object is outside, it is that which citta
experiences. 

The study of citta is actually investigation of the
realities that are appearing at this moment, the realities that are
internal as well as those that are external, and in this way we shall
come to understand the characteristic of citta. Citta is a reality, but
where is it? Citta is an internal reality. When there is seeing, colour
appears outside and citta is the reality that is within; it experiences
what appears through the eyes. 

When we develop understanding, we should investigate the
characteristics of realities as they are, according to the truth the
Buddha realized through his attainment of Buddhahood, and that he taught
to others. He taught the four “Applications of
Mindfulness.”[101](#ftn101) Mindfulness of citta (cittanupassanā
satipaṭṭhāna) means that when there is, for instance seeing, sati is
mindful, non-forgetful, of its characteristic. We should investigate,
study and apply our attention to the reality of seeing so that we shall
gradually have more understanding of it. We can come to know it as the
element that experiences what is appearing through the eyes. 

When there is hearing of sound, sati can arise and be
aware of it, so that hearing can be known as a reality that experiences,
and this is an internal reality. It is not easy to investigate this
reality and to know it as it is. The reality that hears sound arises,
experiences the sound that appears, and then falls away immediately.
This is true for each citta: it arises, experiences an object just for
an extremely short moment, and then it falls away very rapidly. 

When one has right understanding of the citta that sees,
the citta that hears or the citta that thinks, satipaṭṭhāna can arise
and be aware of the characteristic of citta at that moment, and it can
be known as the reality, the element, that experiences something. Paññā
can be developed in conformity with the Dhamma the Buddha taught. Then
paññā can penetrate the characteristics of realities, so that the four
noble Truths can be realized and defilements can be eradicated at the
different stages of enlightenment. These stages are: the stage of the
“stream-winner” (sotāpanna), of the “once-returner” (sakadāgāmī), of the
“non-returner” (anāgāmī) and the stage of the arahat. 

Citta is called “pure” or “clear” (paṇḍaraṃ,
“Dhammasangaṇi”, §6), because citta has only the characteristic of
knowing clearly its object. Thus, its nature is pure. The “Atthasālinī”
(“Expositor” I, Book I, Part IV, Ch II, 140) states, “Mind also is said
to be ‘clear’ in the sense of ‘exceedingly pure’ (parisuddhaṭṭhena
paṇḍaraṃ), with reference to the life-continuum (bhavanga). So the
Buddha has said: 'Bhikkhus, the mind is luminous (pabhassaraṃ), but is
corrupted by adventitious corruptions.' ” The “Atthasālinī” then
explains that when the citta is akusala, it is still called ‘pure’
(paṇḍaraṃ).[102](#ftn102)

The characteristic of citta is clearly knowing an
object, and hence citta is by nature (sabhāva) pure. Even when it is
accompanied by upakilesas (accompanying akusala cetasikas) which defile
it, it is still called paṇḍaram, pure.

Citta is a reality that arises and then falls away
immediately. The falling away of the preceding citta is a condition for
the arising of the succeeding citta. The citta that sees arises and
falls away; a citta that sees does not arise continuously. There are no
cittas that hear, experience tangible object or think continuously. When
we are fast asleep and not dreaming, there are cittas arising and
falling away, succeeding one another. However, at such moments citta
does not experience an object through the eyes, the ears,
the nose, the tongue, the bodysense or the mind-door. 

The citta that does not experience an object through any
of the six doors is the bhavanga-citta. This citta keeps one alive; it
maintains the continuity in one’s life as this particular person.
Bhavanga-cittas arise and fall away until another type of citta arises
that experiences an object through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the
tongue, the bodysense or the mind-door. The bhavanga-cittas arise in
between the processes of cittas that experience objects
through the six doors[103](#ftn103) and this goes on continuously until
the end of one’s lifespan as a particular person. 

The bhavanga-citta does not experience an object through
the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the bodysense or the
mind-door. When someone is fast asleep he does not experience like or
dislike, he is not jealous, stingy, conceited. He has no loving-kindness
or compassion; thus, unwholesome or wholesome qualities do not arise
because he does not see, hear, experience tangible object or think. 

However, it should be known that whenever the citta that
arises experiences an object through one of the six doors, akusala citta
is bound to arise because many different defilements have been
accumulated and these condition the arising of pleasure and attachment
when one sees something pleasant, and the arising of displeasure and annoyance when one sees
something unpleasant. 

When citta arises and cognizes an object through one of
the six doors, what kind of feeling is there? Pleasant feeling,
unpleasant feeling and indifferent feeling are not the reality that is
citta. They are types of cetasikas, mental factors, the Buddha has
called vedanā cetasika, the cetasika that is feeling. Citta as well as
cetasika are nāma, but citta is the “chief,” the “leader” in knowing an
object. Citta is different from vedanā cetasika, which feels pleasant,
unpleasant or indifferent about the object that is appearing. Dhammas
that arise cannot arise singly, they are dependent on other dhammas that
arise simultaneously with them and that condition them. Citta must arise
simultaneously with cetasikas, and cetasikas must arise simultaneously
with the citta. Citta and cetasikas that arise together fall away
together. They experience the same object and they arise and fall away
at the same physical base. Each citta that arises is conditioned by
different cetasikas that accompany it. Each citta performs a different
function and thus, there is a great diversity of types of cittas. 

We do not like it when the citta is annoyed, disturbed,
restless, sad or anxious. We like it when the citta is happy, when it is
full of joy and when it is infatuated with pleasant objects. However,
when the citta is joyful, when it is happy and absorbed in pleasure, the
citta is akusala, because it is accompanied by the cetasika that is
attachment, lobha cetasika. Lobha is the dhamma that takes pleasure in
an object, which clings to it, and is absorbed in it. The Buddha taught
people to study and investigate realities so that sati of satipaṭṭhāna
could be aware of the characteristics of the realities that are appearing[104](#ftn104) and right understanding of them could be
developed. This means that one should investigate realities, notice
their characteristics and be aware of them in order to know them
precisely, just as they are. In this way, we can come to know which
dhammas are kusala, which are akusala and which are neither kusala nor
akusala. We can come to know akusala as akusala, no matter of what
degree, be it coarse or more subtle. It should be known that not only
aversion, dosa, is akusala dhamma, but that there are also many other
types of akusala cetasikas.

People ask what they should do to prevent anger. All
dhammas are non-self, anattā, and thus, also dosa is anattā. Dosa arises
because of its appropriate conditions. There are people who can
eradicate dosa for good, so that it does not arise again. Those people
have developed paññā and realized the four noble Truths to the degree of
the third stage of enlightenment, the stage of the non-returner,
anāgāmī. 

At each stage of enlightenment, the four noble Truths
are realized. The first Truth is the noble Truth of Dukkha. All
conditioned dhammas (saṅkhāra dhammas) are impermanent. They arise and
fall away immediately and therefore they are dukkha, unsatisfactory, not
worth clinging to. They cannot be a refuge. The second noble Truth is
the Origin of Dukkha (dukkha samudaya). This is craving (tanhā), which
is lobha cetasika. Clinging or craving is the origin, the cause, of the
arising of dukkha. The third noble Truth is the Cessation of Dukkha
(dukkha nirodha) and this is nibbāna. Nibbāna is the reality that makes
an end to dukkha because when nibbāna is attained, defilements that
cause the arising of dukkha are eradicated. The fourth noble Truth is
the Way leading to the Cessation of Dukkha (dukkha nirodha gāmini
paṭipadā). This is the Eightfold Path, which is the development of
satipaṭṭhāna, the development of paññā, which can realize the four noble
Truths. This is the practice leading to the cessation of dukkha.

The four noble Truths are realized when enlightenment is
attained, but there are different degrees of realization at the four
stages of enlightenment. The person who has realized the Noble Truths
and experiences nibbāna for the first time when he attains
enlightenment, is a stream-winner, sotāpanna. The sotāpanna has
eradicated wrong view (diṭṭhi) and doubt about the characteristics of
realities. 

When the sotāpanna has developed paññā further, he can
reach the second stage of enlightenment, the stage of the once-returner,
sakadāgāmī. Then he realizes the noble Truths to the degree of that
stage and experiences nibbāna again. The more coarse attachment to
visible object, sound, odour, flavour and tangible object is eradicated
at that stage. 

When the sakadāgāmi has developed paññā further, he can
reach the third stage of enlightenment, the stage of the non-returner,
anāgāmī. Then he realizes the noble Truths to the degree of that stage
and experiences nibbāna again. Attachment to visible object, sound,
odour, flavour, tangible object, and aversion, dosa, are completely
eradicated at that stage. 

When the anāgāmī has developed paññā further, he can
reach the fourth and last stage of enlightenment, the stage of the
perfected one, the arahat. He realizes the noble Truths to the degree of
that stage and experiences nibbāna again. All remaining akusala dhammas
are completely eradicated at that stage. When the arahat passes away,
there is the full extinction of the khandhas (khandha parinibbāna); he
does not have to be reborn anymore. 

Thus, we see that the lokuttara (supramundane) paññā of
the ariyan, the person who has attained enlightenment, eradicates
defilements stage by stage, that is, according to the stage of
enlightenment that has been attained. When we understand this, we should
carefully consider what the right way of practice is for the development
of paññā, which clearly discerns the dhammas that appear and that can
eradicate defilements. The practice should be in conformity with the
Dhamma the Buddha taught.

The Buddha explained citta not only as “that which is
pure” (paṇḍara), he also used the term “manāyatana,” mind-base, for
citta, so that the characteristic of citta would be understood even more
clearly. “Āyatana” is explained in the “Atthasālinī” (Book I, Part IV,
Ch II, §§ 140, 141) as “dwelling place”, “place of birth”, “place of
association” and “cause”. It is explained that the place of birth, the
meeting-place and cause are suitable terms for citta. Citta is place of
birth, because contact, phassa cetasika, and the other cetasikas, arise
“in the citta.” Citta is a place of association because objects from
outside, such as visible object, sound, odour, flavour and tangible
object, “meet” in the citta by being its object. As to the meaning of
cause, hetu, citta is the cause or condition for contact, phassa, and
for the other cetasikas arising together with it; it is
conascent-condition (sahajāta-paccaya) for them.

Each citta is a reality, an element, that experiences an
object. We shall understand more clearly that citta has the
characteristic of anattā if we know that citta is manāyatana, the base
on which other realities depend, place of birth, meeting-place and
cause. 

There may be conditions for the arising of visible
object, sound, odour, flavour, tangible objects such as cold, heat,
softness or hardness. However, if citta does not arise and experience
these objects, if citta is not the “meeting-place” for them, none of
these objects can appear. Then, what can be experienced through the eyes
cannot appear, neither can sound, odour, flavour, cold, heat, softness
or hardness appear. This is because citta is the reality that
experiences an object; it is the base, the place of birth, the
meeting-place, the cause for realities to appear. The colour behind us
cannot appear, because it does not “meet” the citta, it cannot impinge
on the eyesense and does not contact the citta. Hence citta cannot arise
and see an object behind us. 

Although kamma conditions the eyesense that is arising
and falling away continuously throughout life, provided we have not
become blind, the citta that sees cannot arise continuously. Whenever
colour appears, the citta is manāyatana, the meeting-place for the rūpa
that is visible object impinging on the eyesense (cakkhuppasāda rūpa) at
that moment. The rūpa that impinges on the eyesense is rūpāyatana, the
āyatana of visible object, and the eyesense that is impinged on by
visible object is cakkhāyatana, the āyatana of eyesense. All the dhammas
that “meet” or associate at that moment are āyatanas. The same is true
when sound impinges on the earsense and can “meet” the citta that arises
and experiences it. Thus, citta is manāyatana, the meeting-place of the
dhammas that are appearing.

As we have seen, the “Atthasālinī” states that citta is
a cause or condition for phassa, contact, and for the other cetasikas
that accompany citta. Phassa, one among the fifty-two types of
cetasikas, is a kind of nāma that contacts the object. The contact that
is phassa cetasika is mental, it is different from physical contact,
which occurs, for example, when a tree falls down and hits the earth.
The rūpa that is sound may impinge on the rūpa that is earsense, but if
phassa does not arise and contact the sound impinging on the earsense,
the citta that hears cannot arise at all.

Phassa is a type of nāma that arises together with the
citta and falls away together with it. Phassa experiences the same
object as the citta and it arises at the same place of origin as the
citta. Therefore, citta is a condition for phassa. In the planes of
existence where there are five khandhas (nāma and rūpa), citta and
cetasika must always arise at a particular rūpa that is the place of
origin for citta and cetasikas. That rūpa is called “vatthu rūpa,”
physical base. The eyesense is vatthu rūpa, the eye-base, since it is
the place of origin for seeing-consciousness and the cetasikas that
arise together with it.[105](#ftn105) Realities cannot arise singly, on
their own. When a reality arises, there must be other realities that
arise together with it at that moment and that condition it. Whatever
reality conditions another reality to arise simultaneously with it,
conditions that reality by way of conascence-condition,
sahajāta-paccaya.[106](#ftn106)

A conditioning dhamma, a paccaya, is a dhamma that
assists or supports another dhamma to arise or to subsist. Thus, it is
evident that each dhamma that arises is saṅkhāra dhamma, conditioned
dhamma, since it is dependent on other dhammas that are the condition
for its arising. If there were no conditions, no dhamma could arise. 

Different dhammas are different types of conditions.
Some dhammas condition other dhammas to arise together with them; they
are conascence-condition, sahajāta-paccaya. Other dhammas arise before
the dhammas they condition, they are prenascence-condition,
purejāta-paccaya. Other dhammas again arise after the dhammas they
condition, they are postnascence-condition, pacchājāta-paccaya.

Citta is conascence-condition for the cetasikas that
arise simultaneously and the cetasikas are conascence-condition for the
citta they accompany. When contact, phassa, arises and contacts an
object, the citta that arises together with phassa cetasika experiences
that object, not a different one. When phassa cetasika arises and
contacts sound, the hearing-consciousness that arises simultaneously
with phassa cetasika, has that sound as its object. 

There are four paramattha dhammas: citta, cetasika, rūpa
and nibbāna. Each of the paramattha dhammas can be a condition for the
arising of other paramattha dhammas that are saṅkhata dhammas,
conditioned dhammas. Citta can condition the arising of cetasikas and of
rūpas, although not all cittas condition the arising of rūpa. Cetasika
conditions the arising of citta and of rūpa, except in some cases. Rūpa
is a condition for the arising of other rūpas. Rūpa conditions the
arising of citta when it is vatthu, physical base of citta, and when it
is the object of citta. All this evolves according to the nature of the
paramattha dhammas that are conditioned by way of conascence-condition
and by other conditions.

Citta and cetasika are conascence-condition for the rūpa
that arises simultaneously with them immediately at the arising moment
of citta. Each moment of citta can be subdivided into three extremely
short moments:

- the arising moment (uppāda khaṇa); 

- the moment of presence (tiṭṭhi khaṇa), when it has not fallen away
 yet; 

- the moment of dissolution (bhaṅga khaṇa).



Citta cannot direct the arising of rūpa. Rūpa that is
conditioned by citta (cittaja rūpa) arises simultaneously with the
citta, immediately at the arising moment of citta. However, it is
different at the moment the rebirth-

consciousness (paṭisandhi-citta) arises. At that moment there is no rūpa
conditioned by citta, but only rūpa conditioned by kamma (kammaja rūpa)
that arises together with the rebirth-consciousness, which is also
conditioned by kamma. When the rebirth-consciousness has fallen away,
the succeeding citta, the first bhavanga-citta in that life, conditions
rūpa to arise simultaneously with it. From that moment on, throughout
life, citta conditions rūpa. 

However, the sense-cognitions are an exception, they do
not produce any rūpa. There are five pairs of sense-cognitions, one
citta of each pair is kusala vipāka (result of wholesome kamma) and one
citta is akusala vipāka (result of unwholesome kamma). They are the
following pairs of citta: seeing-consciousness, hearing-consciousness,
smelling-consciousness, tasting-consciousness and body-consciousness.
Also, the dying-consciousness of the arahat does not produce any rūpa.
Apart from these types of cittas, each type of citta arising in the
planes where there are five khandhas conditions rūpa to arise
simultaneously with it at its arising moment.[107](#ftn107) 

Each person accumulates inclinations that are variegated
(vicitta). Some people accumulate a great deal of akusala
(unwholesomeness), others a great deal of kusala (wholesomeness). If one
has right understanding of the way of developing satipaṭṭhāna, it can be
developed. All kinds of kusala that are accumulated are beneficial, they
can be “perfections” (pāramīs), supporting conditions for sati to be
mindful of the characteristics of realities, which are non-self, not a
living being, not a person, so that the four noble Truths can be
realized. Defilements can be eradicated in different stages, but for
those who only begin with the development of satipaṭṭhāna, satipaṭṭhāna
is still weak. The clinging to the concept of self is deeply rooted.
Whether one is seeing or hearing, dislikes one’s akusala or performs
kusala, one takes all these realities for self. One believes that one’s
kusala belongs to a self. 

The study of citta paramattha dhamma can be a supporting
condition for the direct understanding of the characteristic of citta
appearing right now, at the present moment. Thus, there can be direct
understanding of the characteristic of the citta that sees, hears or
thinks now. The aim of the study of Dhamma should be the direct
understanding of realities through satipaṭṭhāna. Satipaṭṭhāna can arise
and be aware of the characteristic of the element that experiences
whatever object is appearing.

When we study citta, we should not believe that we can
immediately have clear understanding of the characteristic of citta.
Moreover, the study of citta should not be motivated by the desire to be
a person with a great deal of knowledge about citta. The understanding
acquired from study can be accumulated together with the other sobhana
cetasikas contained in “saṅkhārakkhandha” (the khandha of “formations”)
and, thus, there are conditions for the arising of sati of satipaṭṭhāna.
Sati can be aware of the characteristic of citta that is nāma, the
element that experiences an object at this very moment. In this way,
paññā can develop and eliminate the wrong view that takes all realities
for self. This should be the aim of our study of the Dhamma.
