## Planes of Existence



The term “bhūmi” can mean plane or grade of citta as
well as plane of existence. Bhūmi as plane of existence is the world or
place where living beings are born. There are thirty-one planes of
existence, and these are in conformity with the different grades of
citta which condition birth in these planes. The planes of existence are
the following:

- 11 sensuous planes, kāmabhūmi, 
- 16 rūpa-brahma-bhūmi, 
- 4 arūpa-brahma-bhūmi. 



This is a classification as thirty-one planes by way of
different levels. Actually, there are many more places of birth included
in each of these planes. Even this human plane is not the only human
world, besides this human world there are others. 

The eleven classes of kāmabhūmi include:

- four unhappy planes, 
- the human plane, 
- six heavenly planes or deva planes. 



The four unhappy planes can be summarized as follows:

- hell planes, 

- the animal world, 

- the world of ghosts or petas (pettivisaya), 

- the world of demons (asuras or asurakāyas). 



There is not only one abyss of hell. There is a great
abyss of hell and this has several abysses, such as the Sañjīva Hell,
the Kalasuta Hell, the Sanghāta Hell, the Roruva Hell, the Mahāroruva
Hell, the Tāpana Hell, the Mahātāpana Hell and the Avīci Hell. Apart
from the great hells there are minor hells, but in the scriptures there
is not much reference to these in detail. The Buddha explained about the
different planes in order to point out cause and result. Kusala kamma
and akusala kamma are causes that bring their corresponding results.
What one cannot see clearly through direct experience should not be
explained in a very detailed way and to the same extent as the realities
one can verify oneself through the development of insight.

There are four classes of unhappy planes where living
beings can be reborn. If rebirth is the result of very heavy akusala
kamma there is rebirth in the “Great Hell,” the “Avīci Hell,” where one
suffers extreme torments. When one is freed from that great abyss of
hell and the working of kamma is not yet exhausted, one is reborn in a
small abyss, a minor hell. When someone commits very heavy akusala
kamma, he does not realize that rebirth in a hell plane lies ahead,
since he has not gone there yet. So long as one is still a human being,
living in this world, one does not go to another plane, even though the
cause of rebirth in an unhappy plane, akusala kamma, may already be
there. When someone has committed akusala kamma, it is a condition for
rebirth in an unhappy plane after he has passed away.

The result of akusala kamma of a lesser degree
conditions rebirth in other unhappy planes, such as the animal world. We
can notice that there is an extraordinary variety in the bodily features
of animals. Some kinds have many legs, some only a few, some are without
legs. Some have wings, some are without wings. They live in the water or
on land. It is due to the variegated nature of citta that their bodily
features are so varied. The variety of bodily features of human beings
is not as manifold as those of animals. All humans have a body and they
generally have eyes, ears, nose and tongue. It is true that there are
differences in skin colour and the length of the body, and that there is
variety in outward appearance. However, even if one would take into
account the differences in bodily features of all humans in the world,
including people in the past, the present and the future, their
diversity is not as great as the diversity of animals. The amount of
variety in animals, including those in the water, on land and those that
can fly, is far greater. All this is due to kamma, which causes such
variety.

The result of akusala kamma of a lesser degree than that
which conditions rebirth in the animal world, conditions rebirth in the
planes of ghosts or petas. A ghost is tortured all the time by hunger
and weariness. There are many different ghost planes. Every human being
has a daily recurring disease, namely hunger, and that is the reason why
one can say that it is impossible to be without disease. Hunger is a
grave disease; one can notice this when one suffers from hunger. If
there is but a slight feeling of hunger and one then eats delicious
food, one forgets that hunger is a kind of suffering, something that has
to be completely cured. It may happen that someone is very hungry but
unable to eat because of circumstances, and then he will know the nature
of suffering from hunger.

One day, a person who had many friends received their
telephone calls from morning until evening, and, thus, he had no time to
eat. Late at night he realized that hunger is a great torment and he
understood the expression “pangs of hunger,” referring to the stings in
the stomach or the intestines, caused by hunger. He experienced what
they were like. When he could finally eat, it was not possible to take a
lot of food, all at once, to cure his hunger. This is harmful for the
body and can cause fainting. He had to eat little by little, but he
still fainted. This example shows that hunger is a grave disease, a
daily recurring disease. Ghosts suffer tremendous hunger, for in the
ghost plane there is no means of curing hunger. Agriculture is not
possible on that plane, one cannot plant rice or obtain other crops. One
cannot prepare any food, there is no trade by means of which one can
obtain food. Thus, birth in a ghost plane is the result of akusala
kamma. Ghosts can rejoice in the kusala of humans when humans extend
merit to them in order to let them share in their kusala. When ghosts
rejoice with kusala citta in the good deeds of others it can be a
condition for them to receive food that is suitable in that plane. Or
they may become released from life in the ghost plane; they may pass
away from that life and be reborn in another plane. This can happen if
the kamma that conditioned their birth as a ghost has been exhausted.

Another unhappy plane is the plane of the asuras,
demons. Rebirth as an asura is the result of akusala kamma that is less
grave than the akusala kamma that produces rebirth in one of the other
unhappy planes. If someone is reborn as an asura he has no
entertainment; no way to amuse himself with pleasant objects, such as
there are in the human plane and in the heavenly planes. In the human
plane one can read books, one can watch plays and attend concerts. In
the asura plane there are no such ways of amusement with pleasant
objects. Since akusala kammas are various and of different degrees, the
planes where one can be reborn are also various, in conformity with the
kammas that cause rebirths.

There are seven happy planes of rebirth that are the
results of kāmāvacara kusala kamma, namely, one human plane and six
heavenly planes or deva planes. In the Tipiṭaka it is explained that
there are four human planes where one can be reborn: 

- The Pubbavideha continent, situated to the East of Mount Sineru; 
- The Aparagoyāna continent, situated to the West of Mount Sineru; 
- The Jambudīpa continent, situated to the South of Mount Sineru,
 and this is the human world where we live;
- The Uttarakurū continent, situated to the North of Mount
 Sineru.[179](#ftn179) 



Human beings who live in this world, the Jambudīpa
continent (Rose-Apple Land), can only perceive this world. Wherever they
travel, they see only the objects of the Jambudīpa continent. They are
not able to go to the other three human worlds.

There are six heavenly planes and these have different
degrees of excellence. As to the first plane, this is the heaven of the
four deva rulers or guardians of the world, the “cātu-mahārājika
plane.”[180](#ftn180) These four deva rulers are:

- Dhaṭarattha, sometimes called Inda, ruling over the East, over the
 Gandhabba devas; 
- Virūḷha, sometimes called Yama, ruling over the South, over the
 Khumbhaṇḍa devas; 
- Virūpaka, sometimes called Varuṇa, ruling over the West, over the
 Nagas; 
- Kuvera, sometimes called Vessavaṇa or Vesuvanna, ruling over the
 North, over the Yakkas. 



The heavenly plane of the four deva rulers is the lowest
class of heaven and this is not as far away from the human world as the
higher heavenly planes.

There are higher deva planes and these have different
degrees of excellence corresponding with the levels of these planes. 

The second heavenly plane is the Heaven of the
Thirty-three, Tāvatimsa, and this plane is higher than the plane of the
four deva rulers. Inda is the chief of this plane. In the heaven of the
Thirty-three there are four heavenly groves: 

- Nandana Grove in the East,[181](#ftn181) 
- Cittalatā Grove in the West, 
- Missaka Grove in the North, 
- Phārusaka Grove in the South. 



The third heavenly plane is the Yāma heaven, which is
higher than the heaven of the Thirty-three.

The fourth heavenly plane is Tusita, which is higher
than Yama.

The fifth heavenly plane is the “heaven of the devas who
delight in creating,” Nimmānarati, which is higher than Tusita.

The sixth heavenly plane is the “heaven of devas who
rule over others’ creations,” Paranimittavasavatti, which is higher than
Nimmānarati. This plane is the highest of the sense sphere planes.

To which heavenly plane would we like to go? Someone who
is not an arahat still has to be reborn, but where will he be reborn? It
will probably not be in a brahma plane, because birth as a brahma in a
brahma plane is the result of kusala jhānacitta if this arises just
before dying, as has been explained. Thus, rebirth in a sensuous plane
is more likely. Whether there will be rebirth in an unhappy plane or a
happy plane depends on the cause that produces rebirth, namely kamma, a
deed that has been performed during the cycle of lives.

The rūpāvacara bhūmis, fine material planes of
existence, are the planes where rūpa brahmas are born. Birth in these
planes is the result of fine-material jhāna, rūpa-jhāna. There are
sixteen rūpa brahma planes.[182](#ftn182)

The result of the first jhāna can be birth in three
planes: 

- birth in the Pārisajja plane, the result of kusala jhānacitta of a
 weak degree; 
- birth in the Purohita plane, the result of kusala jhānacitta of
 medium degree;
- birth in the Mahābrahmā plane, the result of kusala jhānacitta of
 superior degree. 



The result of the second jhāna of the fourfold system
(and the third jhāna of the fivefold system)[183](#ftn183) can be birth
in three planes. This depends on the degree of jhāna, which can be weak,
medium or superior. These planes are:

- Parittābha bhūmi, 
- Appamāṇabha bhūmi, 
- Ābhassara bhūmi. 



The result of the third jhāna of the fourfold system
(and the fourth jhāna of the fivefold system) can be birth in the
following three planes, depending on the degree of jhāna:

- Parittasubha bhūmi, 
- Appamāṇasubha bhūmi, 
- Subhakiṇha bhūmi.



The result of the fourth jhāna of the fourfold system
(and the fifth jhāna of the fivefold system) can be birth in the
Vehapphala bhūmi.

Moreover, there can be birth in the Asaññāsatta bhūmi as
result of the fifth jhāna. Beings who are born in this plane are born
only with rūpa, not with citta and cetasika.[184](#ftn184)

There are five Suddhāvāsā planes (Pure Abodes) for
anāgāmīs and these births are the results of the fourth jhāna of the
fourfold system (and the fifth jhāna of the fivefold system). They are:

- Aviha bhūmi, 
- Atappa bhūmi, 
- Sudassa bhūmi, 
- Sudassi bhūmi, 
- Akaṇiṭṭha bhūmi. 



There are four arūpa-brahma planes. Birth in these
planes is the result of immaterial jhāna, arūpa-jhāna. The meditation
subject of arūpa -jhāna is no longer dependent on rūpa. Corresponding
with the four stages of arūpa-jhāna, these planes are the following:

- the plane of infinite space, ākāsānañcāyatana bhūmi; 
- the plane of infinite consciousness, viññāṇañcāyatana bhūmi; 
- the plane of nothingness, ākiñcaññāyatana bhūmi; 
- the plane of neither perception nor non-perception,
 n’evasaññā-n’āsaññāyatana bhūmi. 



In these four arūpa-brahma planes there are only
nāma-khandhas, cittas and cetasikas, there is no arising of any rūpa at
all.

In the “Gradual Sayings” (I, Book of the Threes, Ch
VIII, § 80, Abhibhu, 3) we read that the Buddha explained to Ānanda
about the manifold world systems. In the “thousand lesser worlds” are
included a thousandfold of the four human planes, of the deva planes and
of the brahma worlds. We read that the Buddha said:

> “As far as moon and sun move in their course and light up all quarters
with their radiance, so far extends the thousandfold world-system.
Therein are a thousand moons, a thousand suns, a thousand Sinerus, lords
of mountains; a thousand Rose-Apple Lands, a thousand Western Oxwains
(Aparagoyāna), a thousand northern Kurus, a thousand Eastern Videhās;
four thousand mighty oceans, four thousand Mighty Rulers, a thousand
“Four Great Rulers” (the four world guardians), a thousand heavens of
the Thirty-three, a thousand Yama worlds, a thousand heavens of the
Devas of Delight, a thousand heavens of the Devas that delight in
creation, a thousand heavens of the Devas that delight in others’
creations, and a thousand Brahma worlds. This, Ānanda, is called ‘The
system of the thousand lesser worlds.’ A system a thousandfold the size
of this is called ‘The Twice-a-thousand Middling Thousandfold
World-system.’ A system a thousandfold the size of this is called ‘The
Thrice-a-thousand Mighty Thousandfold World-system.’ Now, Ānanda, if he
wished it, the Tathāgata could make his voice heard throughout this
last-named world-system, or even further, if he chose.”

The explanation of the world-systems may not be as
detailed as some people who have doubts would wish, but it shows the
perfection of wisdom (paññā pāramī) of the Buddha, who is the “Knower of
the Worlds” (lokavidū), the person who clearly knows all worlds.

As we have seen, the fourth aspect of citta, mentioned
by the “Atthasālinī” is that citta is variegated according to
circumstance, because of the sampayutta dhammas, the accompanying
cetasikas. Therefore, cittas can be classified as different kinds in
various ways. Cittas can be classified by way of the four jātis of
kusala, akusala, vipāka and kiriya. Cittas can also be classified by way
of the four planes of consciousness: kāmāvacara citta, rūpāvacara citta,
arūpā-vacara citta and lokuttara citta.

Kāmāvacara cittas can be of the four jātis of kusala,
akusala, vipāka and kiriya. The cittas of the higher planes, namely
rūpāvacara cittas, arūpāvacara cittas and lokuttara cittas, cannot be of
the jāti of akusala. Lokuttara cittas cannot be of the jāti of kiriya
either.

Thus, rūpāvacara cittas can be of three jātis: kusala,
vipāka and kiriya. Rūpāvacara kusala citta can cause the arising of
rūpāvacara vipākacitta that performs the function of rebirth in one of
the rūpa-brahma planes of existence. The rūpāvacara kusala citta of the
fifth stage of jhāna can condition rebirth as asaññāsatta, a being with
only rūpa, in the asaññāsatta plane. As we have seen, there are sixteen
rūpa-brahma planes in all. The arahat who attains the stages of
rūpa-jhāna has rūpāvacara kiriyacitta. 

The arūpāvacara kusala citta can cause the arising of
arūpāvacara vipākacitta that performs the function of rebirth in one of
the four arūpa-brahma planes. The arahat who attains the stages of
arūpa-jhāna has arūpāvacara kiriyacitta.

Rūpāvacara citta and arūpāvacara citta are sublime
consciousness, mahaggatā citta. The “Atthasālinī” (I, Book I, Part I, Ch
I, Mātikā, Triplets, 44) states:

> “ ‘Sublime’ (mahaggatā) means, ‘having reached greatness’[185](#ftn185),
from ability to discard corruptions, from the abundance of fruition,
from the length of duration...”

It is most difficult to discard defilements. As soon as
we have seen an object, like or dislike arises. However, when there is
attainment concentration (appanā samādhi), thus, when jhānacitta arises,
the citta is calm and one-pointed on the meditation subject that is
experienced through the mind-door. At such moments, there is no seeing,
hearing, smelling, tasting or the experience of tangible object. When
there are jhānacittas, no matter for how long, there cannot be
bhavanga-cittas in between, such as in the case of kāmāvacara
cittas.[186](#ftn186) Kāmāvacara cittas experience an object for an
extremely short moment, they are insignificant dhammas (paritta
dhammas). The kāmāvacara cittas of seeing, hearing or thinking occur in
processes that are of extremely short duration, they experience an
object just for a moment. When cittas of the eye-door process arise and
experience visible object which appears through the eye-door, and then
fall away, there have to be bhavanga-cittas immediately afterwards.
Bhavanga-cittas arise before there are cittas in the mind-door process
that cognize the visible object that was experienced in the preceding
eye-door process. Kāmāvacara dhammas, which are visible object, sound,
odour, flavour, tangible object as well as the cittas that experience
these sense objects, are all insignificant dhammas (paritta dhammas). 

The mahaggatā cittas, “sublime cittas,” namely the
rūpāvacara cittas and the arūpāvacara cittas, are cittas that have
reached excellence because they can subdue defilements. When there is
attainment concentration, when jhānacittas arise and fall away in
succession, there is no seeing, no hearing, no experience of an object
through one of the sense-doors, neither is there thinking about these
objects. That is the reason why it is said that mahaggatā citta discards
defilements. However, when the jhānacittas have fallen away completely,
kāmāvacara cittas arise again. When there are cittas arising in
processes that experience objects through the different doorways,
akusala javana-citta has the opportunity to arise if one does not
perform kusala. So long as defilements have not been eradicated
completely, akusala citta is likely to arise after seeing, hearing,
smelling, tasting and the experience of tangible object. Do we realize
that akusala citta arises time and again? If one does not realize this,
one cannot subdue defilements nor can one develop the way leading to the
eradication of defilements.

Before the Buddha’s enlightenment, there were people who
saw the disadvantages and the danger of akusala cittas which arise very
soon after seeing, hearing and the other sense-cognitions. Therefore,
they tried to find a way to temporarily subdue defilements. They found
out that the only way leading to that goal was not to see, to hear or to
experience the other sense objects. When one experiences sense objects,
one cannot prevent the arising of defilements. People who understood
this could cultivate the way of kusala which leads to true calm,
temporary freedom from attachment (lobha), aversion (dosa) and ignorance
(moha), and this is realized at the moment of attainment concentration,
appanā samādhi. 

At the moment of jhānacitta there are no sense
impressions. There is only the experience of the meditation subject
through the mind-door and this is a condition for the citta to be firmly
established in calmness and one-pointedness on that object. Attainment
concentration that is reached when jhānacitta arises does not lead to
the complete eradication of defilements. When the jhānacittas have
fallen away, defilements have the opportunity to arise again. Only at
the moments of rūpāvacara citta and arūpāvacara citta, citta has reached
excellence; it is mahaggatā citta, because it can subdue defilements by
not seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or experiencing tangible object.


This is different in the case of the anāgāmī
(non-returner), the person who has reached the third stage of
enlightenment. He sees, but there is no attachment to visible object,
since he has eradicated attachment to sense objects. He hears, smells,
tastes and experiences through the bodysense the tangible objects of
heat, cold, hardness, softness, motion and pressure, but he has no
attachment, he has eradicated attachment to these objects. The lokuttara
kusala citta, which is the magga-citta, path-consciousness, can
eradicate defilements completely. Thus, we see that citta is variegated
as there are four planes of citta that are the four grades or levels of
kāmāvacara, rūpāvacara, arūpāvacara and lokuttara.

Rūpāvacara citta and arūpāvacara citta can be of three
jātis: kusala, vipāka and kiriya.

Lokuttara citta is of two jātis: kusala and vipāka.
There is no lokuttara kiriyacitta.

There are eight types of lokuttara citta, corresponding
with the four stages of enlightenment. For each stage there is the
magga-citta, path-consciousness, which is lokuttara kusala citta, and
the fruition-consciousness, phala-citta, which is lokuttara vipākacitta.
The eight types of lokuttara

cittas are the following:

- path-consciousness of the sotāpanna (sotāpatti magga-citta), which
 is lokuttara kusala citta; 
- fruition-consciousness of the sotāpanna (sotāpatti phala-citta)
 which is lokuttara vipākacitta; 
- path-consciousness of the sakadāgāmī (sakadāgāmī magga-citta),
 which is lokuttara kusala citta; 
- fruition-consciousness of the sakadāgāmī (sakadāgāmī phala-citta),
 which is lokuttara vipākacitta;
- path-consciousness of the anāgāmī (anāgāmī magga-citta), which is
 lokuttara kusala citta; 
- fruition-consciousness of the anāgāmī (anāgāmī phala-citta), which
 is lokuttara vipākacitta; 
- path-consciousness of the arahat (arahatta magga-citta), which is
 lokuttara kusala citta; 
- fruition-consciousness of the arahat (arahatta phala-citta), which
 is lokuttara vipākacitta. 



The lokuttara kusala citta is the condition for the
lokuttara vipākacitta to succeed it immediately; there is no other type
of citta arising in between the lokuttara kusala citta, which is cause,
and the lokuttara vipākacitta, which is result. Apart from the lokuttara
kusala citta, no other type of kusala citta can produce vipākacitta
immediately succeeding it. 

As soon as the magga-citta of the sotāpanna, which is
lokuttara kusala citta, has fallen away, it is succeeded by the
phala-citta that is lokuttara vipākacitta. It is the same in the case of
the magga-citta and the phala-citta of the sakadāgāmī, the anāgāmī and
the arahat.

The four types of lokuttara vipākacitta, the
phala-cittas, cannot perform the functions of rebirth, bhavanga and
dying. They are different from mundane vipākacittas.[187](#ftn187) The
lokuttara vipākacitta that immediately succeeds the lokuttara kusala
citta also has nibbāna as object. The lokuttara vipākacitta, the
phala-citta, performs the function of javana in the same process as the
lokuttara kusala citta that precedes it. The phala-citta is the only
type of vipākacitta that can perform the function of javana in a
process. It performs the function of javana and it has nibbāna as
object. Each type of lokuttara kusala citta arises only once in the
cycle of birth and death and it eradicates defilements completely, in
conformity with the stage of enlightenment that has been attained.
However, there are two or three lokuttara vipākacittas arising after the
lokuttara kusala citta; these succeed one another and have nibbāna as
object. It depends on the type of person who attains enlightenment
whether phala-citta arises two or three times.

The sotāpanna cannot be reborn more than seven times. As
we have seen, the phala-citta of the sotāpanna cannot perform the
function of rebirth. The type of vipākacitta which performs for the
sotāpanna the function of rebirth is in accordance with the plane of
existence where he will be reborn. If the sotāpanna is reborn in a
heavenly plane, kāmāvacara vipākacitta performs the function of rebirth.
If the sotāpanna is reborn in a brahma plane, rūpāvacara vipākacitta or
arūpāvacara vipākacitta performs the function of rebirth in accordance
with that plane. 

As we have seen, the word bhūmi, plane, can refer to the
grade of citta as well as to the plane of existence for living beings.
Summarizing, when bhūmi is used in the sense of grade of citta, there
are four bhūmis: kāmāvacara citta, rūpāvacara citta, arūpāvacara citta
and lokuttara citta. When bhūmi is used in the sense of the place where
living beings are born, the world where they live, there are thirty-one
planes and these correspond with the different grades of citta: eleven
kāma bhūmis, sixteen rūpa-brahma planes and four arūpa-brahma planes.
