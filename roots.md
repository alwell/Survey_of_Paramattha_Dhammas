## Roots

Cittas are variegated on account of the associated
dhammas, sampayutta dhammas, which are roots, hetus.

The realities that are saṅkhāra dhammas, conditioned
dhammas, cannot arise just by themselves, without being dependent on
conditions for their arising. There are three kinds of paramattha
dhammas that are saṅkhāra dhamma: citta, cetasika and rūpa. Citta is
dependent on cetasika as condition for its arising and cetasika is
dependent on citta for its arising. Some cittas are dependent on both
cetasika and rūpa as conditions for their arising. Rūpas are dependent
on other rūpas as condition for their arising. Some rūpas are dependent
on citta, cetasika and other rūpas as condition for their arising. 

Cittas are variegated on account of the different roots,
hetus, which accompany them. Some cittas arise together with cetasikas
that are hetus, whereas other cittas arise without hetus. Only six
cetasikas are hetus:

 
**3 akusala hetus:**

- lobha cetasika is the hetu that is lobha
- dosa cetasika is the hetu that is dosa
- moha cetasika is the hetu that is moha

**3 sobhana hetus:**

- alobha cetasika is the hetu that is alobha
- adosa cetasika is the hetu that is adosa
- paññā cetasika is the hetu that is amoha1



Dhammas other than these six cetasikas cannot be
root-condition, hetu-paccaya. The cetasikas that are not hetus condition
citta while they arise together with it, but they are not a condition by
way of hetu-paccaya, by being roots. Hetu-paccaya is only one condition
among the twenty-four principal conditions for phenomena. 

The six cetasikas which are roots, hetus, can be
compared to the roots of a tree, which make it thrive and become fully
grown, so that it flowers and bears much fruit. When the six kinds of
hetus arise, they also make the dhammas they accompany thrive and
develop so that they can produce much fruit, evermore, again and again.
Those who are not arahats still have both akusala hetus and kusala
hetus. For the arahat there are no akusala hetus nor are there kusala
hetus. The cetasikas alobha, adosa and paññā (amoha), that accompany the
kiriyacitta which performs the function of javana in the case of the
arahat are indeterminate roots, avyākata hetus, roots that are neither
kusala nor akusala.[^197] 

Indeterminate dhammas, avyākata dhammas, are realities
that are neither kusala nor akusala, namely: vipākacitta, kiriyacitta,
vipāka cetasikas, kiriya cetasikas, rūpa and nibbāna.

As we have seen, the six hetus can be classified as
twofold: as the three akusala hetus of lobha, dosa and moha, and as the
three sobhana hetus of alobha, adosa and paññā. In this classification
the term sobhana, beautiful, is used and not kusala. The hetus that are
kusala condition kusala vipāka, result, which arises later on. Whereas
sobhana hetus arise with kusala citta, with kusala
vipākacitta[^198] and with sobhana kiriyacitta. Thus, sobhana
hetus do not merely arise with kusala citta.

The four paramattha dhammas can be classified as twofold
by way of not hetu (in Pāli na-hetu) and hetu: 

- citta: not-hetu (na-hetu); 
- cetasika: only six of the fifty-two cetasikas are hetu, the other
 forty-six cetasikas are not-hetu (na-hetu); 
- rūpa: not-hetu (na-hetu); 
- nibbāna: not-hetu (na-hetu). 

Citta and forty-six cetasikas are na-hetu. Some cittas
and cetasikas are accompanied by cetasikas that are hetus; they are
sahetuka citta and cetasika.[^199] Some cittas and cetasikas are
not accompanied by hetus, they are ahetuka citta and cetasika.

Seeing-consciousness, which sees visible object that
appears, is accompanied by only seven cetasikas: by contact, feeling,
remembrance, volition, life faculty, one-pointedness and attention.
Contact, phassa cetasika, performs the function of contacting the
visible object that impinges on the eye-sense. Feeling, vedanā cetasika,
performs the function of feeling; in this case it is upekkhā vedanā,
which feels indifferent about visible object. Remembrance or perception,
saññā cetasika, performs the function of remembering visible object that
appears through the eyesense. Volition, cetanā cetasika, which performs
in this case, since it is neither kusala nor akusala, the function of
coordinating and urging citta and the accompanying cetasikas to
accomplish their own tasks. Life faculty, jīvitindriya cetasika,
performs the function of watching over citta and the accompanying
cetasikas, maintaining their life, but only so long as they are present.
One-pointedness or concentration, ekaggatā cetasika, performs the
function of focussing on the object that appears. Attention, manasikāra
cetasika, performs the function of being attentive to the visible
object. 

These seven cetasikas are not-hetu, and, therefore,
seeing-consciousness is ahetuka vipākacitta. Lobha-mūla-citta, which may
arise after seeing, is accompanied by two cetasikas which are hetus:
lobha, the dhamma which enjoys what appears and clings to it, and moha,
the dhamma which is ignorant of realities. Thus, lobha-mūla-citta is
sahetuka citta, accompanied by roots. 

When we take into consideration hetu and na-hetu, and
also sahetuka and ahetuka, saṅkhāra dhammas can be classified as
follows:

- rūpa: is na-hetu and ahetuka; 
- citta: is na-hetu; some cittas are sahetuka and some are ahetuka;
- cetasika: forty six cetasikas are na-hetu; some cetasikas are
 sahetuka and some are ahetuka. Six cetasikas are hetu: lobha, dosa,
 moha, alobha, adosa and paññā; the cetasikas that are themselves
 hetu are sahetuka when accompanying other hetus. Moha which
 accompanies moha-mūla-citta is ahetuka.



Lobha cetasika is sahetuka because every time it is
accompanied by another hetu, by moha. If moha cetasika does not arise,
lobha cetasika cannot arise either. Dosa cetasika is also sahetuka,
since it has to be accompanied every time by moha. Moha that accompanies
lobha-mūla-citta is sahetuka, because it arises in that case together
with the hetu that is lobha. Moha that accompanies dosa-mūla-citta is
sahetuka, because it arises in that case together with the hetu that is
dosa. Moha that accompanies moha-mūla-citta is ahetuka, because moha is
in that case the only root, it does not arise together with lobha or
dosa. 

Contact, phassa cetasika, which accompanies every citta,
is not-hetu, na-hetu. Whenever citta arises together with a cetasika
that is hetu, the accompanying phassa is sahetuka. Whenever ahetuka
citta arises, the accompanying phassa is also ahetuka. Thus phassa,
which is na-hetu, is sometimes sahetuka and sometimes ahetuka.

Our daily life consists of sahetuka cittas as well as
ahetuka cittas. If one has not listened to the Dhamma and studied it,
one will not know when there are sahetuka cittas and when ahetuka
cittas. The Buddha explained in detail which cittas are ahetuka and
which are sahetuka. He explained which types of hetus, and which types
of other cetasikas are accompanied by sahetuka cittas; he also indicated
the number of accompanying dhammas. For example: 

- Moha-mūla-citta is accompanied by one hetu, by moha; it is
 eka-hetuka (eka means one). 
- Lobha-mūla-citta is accompanied by two hetus, by moha and lobha;
 it is dvi-hetuka (dvi is two). 
- Dosa-mūla-citta is accompanied by the hetus of moha and dosa; it
 is also dvi-hetuka. 



As regards kusala citta, this must be accompanied by
sobhana hetus, otherwise it would not be kusala. Kusala cittas can be
differentiated as unaccompanied by paññā cetasika and as accompanied by
paññā cetasika. Kusala citta which is unaccompanied by paññā arises with
two hetus, with alobha, non-attachment, and adosa, non-aversion, and,
thus, it is dvi-hetuka. Kusala citta that is accompanied by paññā arises
with three hetus: alobha, adosa and amoha, thus, it is ti-hetuka (ti
means three). Kusala citta cannot be accompanied by one hetu, it needs
to be accompanied each time by at least the two hetus of alobha and
adosa.

Root-condition, hetu-paccaya, is one condition among the
twenty-four conditions. A conditioning factor is a dhamma which assists
other dhammas and conditions their arising or maintains them, depending
on the type of condition. Phassa cetasika, for example, is different
from lobha cetasika, but both phassa and lobha are conditioning factors
that assist other dhammas, citta, cetasika and rūpa, in conditioning
their arising. However, since the characteristic and function of phassa
are different from those of lobha, these two cetasikas are each a
different kind of condition.

Phassa cetasika is nutrition-condition, āhāra-paccaya.
This type of condition brings its own fruit or result, in this case
feeling.[^200] This type of condition is different from
root-condition, hetu-paccaya; a root is a firm foundation for the
dhammas it conditions. As we have seen, the hetus have been

compared to the roots of a tree, which make the tree thrive and develop.
However, a tree does not solely depend on the roots for its growth and
development. It also needs earth and water, it needs nutrition so that
it is able to bear fruit. If, on the other hand, the roots are lacking,
earth and water alone will not be able to make it grow and prosper.
Thus, a tree needs different conditions for its growth. Even so, there
are six hetus, which are root-condition, but besides these there are
also other types of conditions. Phenomena condition other phenomena in
different ways. 

In the seventh book of the Abhidhamma, the “Conditional
Relations,” the “Paṭṭhāna”, all the different ways of conditionality
have been expounded. The first condition that is mentioned is
root-condition, hetu-paccaya. Thus, we can see the importance of the
dhammas that are hetus. When during a cremation ceremony the monks chant
texts from the Abhidhamma, they start with “hetu-paccaya,” comprising
the six hetus of lobha, dosa, moha, alobha, adosa and amoha. Thus it is
emphasized that the dhammas that are these hetus bring results, that
they condition rebirth, and that, in this way, the cycle of birth and
death goes on.

There are many kinds of conditions and all of them are
important. The Buddha did not teach solely root-condition, hetu-paccaya.
Nor did he teach solely object-condition, ārammaṇa-paccaya. In the case
of object-condition, the object is a condition for citta to arise and to
know that object. The Buddha taught all the different conditions in
detail. He taught twenty-four principal conditions and also other
conditions that are derived from some of the principal conditions.

The rūpa that is eyesense, cakkhuppasāda rūpa, does not
arise from hetu-paccaya, but from other conditions. In its turn it is a
condition for other dhammas as faculty-condition, indriya-paccaya. It is
leader in its own function: it is the faculty that conditions
seeing-consciousness to arise and to see the visible object that
appears. Thus, it conditions seeing-consciousness by way of
faculty-condition, indriya-paccaya. If there were no rūpas of eyesense,
earsense, smelling-sense, tasting-sense and bodysense, the body would be
like a log of wood. One would not be able to see, to hear or to
experience the other sense objects. The five pasāda rūpas, the senses,
are faculty-condition, they are leaders in performing their function,
each in their own field. Eyesense is the leader as to its own function
of receiving visible object, it is the condition for
seeing-consciousness to arise and to see visible object. The other rūpas
could not perform this function. It depends on the keenness of the
eyesense whether what appears through it is clear or vague. This has
nothing to do with someone’s will or wish; it depends on the eyesense,
which is faculty-condition for seeing.

Each kind of dhamma is a condition for the arising of
other dhammas and there are different ways of conditionality. Lobha,
dosa, moha, alobha, adosa and paññā condition other dhammas by being
their roots. Many times a day akusala hetus arise, they arise more often
than kusala hetus. At times there are kusala hetus and when these
gradually develop and become more powerful, akusala hetus will dwindle.
Paññā should be developed so that the characteristics of realities can
be known as they are. It is paññā, the hetu of amoha, which understands
realities as they are. So long as paññā does not clearly know the
characteristics of realities, the akusala hetus of lobha, dosa and moha
are bound to thrive and develop. There is no reality other than paññā,
amoha, which can eradicate the akusala hetus. When one studies the
Dhamma, understands the characteristics of the realities appearing
through the six doors and develops satipaṭṭhāna, the kusala cetasika
amoha, or paññā, will gradually grow. When one realizes the four noble
Truths at the attainment of the first stage of enlightenment, the stage
of the sotāpanna, different kinds of defilements are eradicated in
conformity with that stage. It is at the attainment of arahatship that
all defilements are eradicated.

The noble persons of the stages of the sotāpanna, the
sakadāgāmī and the anāgāmī are called “learners,” sekha puggala. They
have to continue to develop paññā until, at the attainment of
arahatship, akusala hetus as well as kusala hetus do not arise anymore.
The arahat who has eradicated all defilements and has reached the end of
rebirth, does not have kusala hetus, because these would be a condition
for the arising of kusala vipāka in the future, endlessly. The arahat
has cittas accompanied by alobha, adosa and amoha, but these are
indeterminate roots, avyākata hetus, which do not condition vipāka in
the future. 

One may wonder whether one will ever reach that stage.
We shall reach that stage one day if we are patient and persevere with
the development of right understanding, day in day out. There were many
people in the past who attained arahatship and if it were impossible to
attain this result, there would not have been anybody who attained it.
However, it cannot be attained as quickly as one would hope, the result
is in conformity with the cause. If paññā does not arise yet, if it does
not develop, defilements cannot be eradicated. Paññā can be gradually
developed, stage by stage, and then it will be able to penetrate the
true characteristics of realities. In this way, defilements can be
eradicated.

We should never forget the aim of the study of citta,
cetasika and rūpa. The aim is the development of satipaṭṭhāna, thus, the
understanding of the true characteristics of citta, cetasika and rūpa,
just as they naturally appear; one at a time. This is the truth the
Buddha realized through his enlightenment and taught to others. It may
happen that one has studied the Dhamma but does not practise in
conformity with what one has learnt. That is an inconsistency. When one
has studied the realities from the texts but one does not learn to
directly understand them as they are when they appear, it is impossible
to eradicate defilements.

The akusala hetus of lobha, dosa and moha that arise are
of the jāti that is akusala, they cannot be of another jāti. The akusala
hetus condition the arising of akusala citta and they are accumulated
evermore and carried on to the future. The three sobhana hetus of
alobha, adosa and paññā can be of the jātis that are kusala, vipāka and
kiriya, as they accompany kusala citta, kusala vipākacitta or
kiriyacitta. As we have seen, sobhana comprises more dhammas than
kusala. Sobhana dhammas comprise realities which are kusala, kusala
vipāka and sobhana kiriya. 

When all dhammas are classified as three groups, namely
as kusala dhammas, akusala dhammas and indeterminate dhammas, avyākata
dhammas, the six cetasikas which are hetus are classified as nine in the
following way:

- three akusala hetus, namely, lobha, dosa and moha; 
- three kusala hetus, namely, alobha, adosa and paññā; 
- three avyākata hetus, namely, alobha, adosa and paññā.
