## Sobhana and Asobhana

Cittas can be classified as sobhana and asobhana.
Sobhana dhammas are realities that are “beautiful.” Sobhana dhammas do
not only comprise kusala dhammas, but also dhammas which are kusala
vipāka, the result of kusala kamma, and sobhana kiriya dhammas, the
cittas of the arahat who has neither kusala nor akusala. 

Asobhana dhamma is the opposite of sobhana dhamma.
Asobhana dhammas are dhammas that are not sobhana, not beautiful.
Asobhana dhammas do not only comprise akusala citta and cetasika, but
also all cittas and cetasikas that are not accompanied by sobhana
cetasikas. Thus, when cittas are classified by way of associated
dhammas, sampayutta dhammas, which condition citta to be varied, cittas
can be differentiated as sobhana and asobhana. This means that cittas
are classified as accompanied or unaccompanied by the cetasikas that are
the sobhana hetus of alobha, adosa and paññā. The sobhana hetus are
sobhana cetasikas, which condition citta to be sobhana. Therefore, the
classification of citta as sobhana and asobhana should follow upon the
classification of citta by way of hetus. All cittas that are accompanied
by sobhana hetus are sobhana cittas and all cittas that are not
accompanied by sobhana hetus are asobhana cittas.

When we study paramattha dhammas we should carefully
investigate cause and result. If we clearly understand cause and result,
we shall not have any misunderstanding as to sobhana dhammas and
asobhana dhammas. 

Akusala citta arises together with the akusala cetasikas
of lobha, dosa and moha and thus it is clear that it is not sobhana
citta.

Seeing-consciousness cannot arise together with lobha,
dosa or moha, or with any of the sobhana cetasikas. Seeing-consciousness
is accompanied only by seven cetasikas: contact (phassa), feeling
(vedanā), remembrance (saññā), volition (cetanā), one-pointedness or
concentration (ekaggatā), life-faculty (jīvitindriya) and attention
(manasikāra). These seven cetasikas are the universals
(sabbacitta-sādhāraṇā); they have to accompany each and every citta.
Citta cannot arise without these seven cetasikas, no matter whether it
is akusala citta, kusala citta, vipākacitta, kiriyacitta, lokuttara
citta or any other type of citta. The seven “universals” and six other
cetasikas, the particulars (pakiṇṇakā), which do not arise with every
citta, can be of four jātis according to the type of citta they
accompany.[^201] The “universals” and the “particulars”, taken
together, are the aññasamāna cetasikas.[^202] When the
aññasamāna cetasikas arise with akusala citta, they are akusala, and
when they arise with kusala citta, they are kusala. Whereas akusala
cetasikas accompany only akusala citta and sobhana cetasikas accompany
only sobhana citta. 

Seeing-consciousness is vipākacitta, which is
accompanied only by the seven universals, not by sobhana cetasikas or by
akusala cetasikas. Thus, seeing-consciousness is asobhana citta, but it
is not akusala citta.

When one studies the Dhamma, one should understand
precisely the difference between akusala dhammas and asobhana dhammas.
Akusala dhammas are realities that are mean, inferior, dangerous. They
are causes that produce unpleasant and sorrowful results. Asobhana
dhammas are citta and cetasika that are not accompanied by sobhana
cetasikas. The Buddha taught the Dhamma by various methods and under
different aspects, according to the true characteristics of realities.
When we study the Dhamma we should investigate the characteristics of
realities in detail, so that we can understand them as they are. As we
have seen, dhammas can be classified as threefold, as kusala dhamma,
akusala dhamma and avyākata (indeterminate) dhamma. We should remember
that kusala dhammas are realities that are cause, producing kusala
vipāka. Akusala dhammas are realities that are cause producing akusala
vipāka. Avyākata dhammas are realities that are neither kusala nor
akusala. They are vipākacitta and cetasika, kiriyacitta and cetasika,
rūpa and nibbāna. Thus, avyākata dhamma comprises not only citta and
cetasika that are vipāka and kiriya, but also the paramattha dhammas
that are rūpa and nibbāna. Rūpa and nibbāna cannot be kusala or akusala
because they are not citta or cetasika. Thus, all four paramattha
dhammas can be classified as these three groups of dhammas. When dhammas
are classified as four jātis, this classification refers only to citta
and cetasika.

The cittas and cetasikas of the four jātis can be
classified as sobhana and asobhana in the following way:

- akusala citta and accompanying cetasikas which are asobhana, 
- kusala citta and accompanying cetasikas which are sobhana,
- vipākacitta and kiriyacitta (unaccompanied by sobhana cetasikas
 such as alobha and adosa) which are asobhana, 
- vipākacitta and kiriyacitta (accompanied by sobhana cetasikas)
 which are sobhana. 



Seeing-consciousness that is kusala vipāka and
seeing-consciousness that is akusala vipāka are accompanied only by the
seven universals. It is the same for the other four pairs of
sense-cognitions, they are accompanied only by the seven universals.
Thus, the five pairs of sense-cognitions, the dvipañcaviññāṇa, are
asobhana cittas. Moreover, there are cittas other than these ten that
are asobhana, not accompanied by sobhana cetasikas. 

Some kusala vipākacittas are asobhana and some are
sobhana, accompanied by sobhana cetasikas. Each citta that arises in
daily life is different. The rebirth-consciousness arising in the human
plane of existence is different from the rebirth-consciousness arising
in an unhappy plane, they are results produced by different kammas. A
being born in an unhappy plane has a rebirth-consciousness that is
akusala vipāka, the result of akusala kamma. Rebirth-consciousness that
is akusala vipāka can arise in a hell plane, a ghost plane (pitti
visaya), in the plane of demons (asuras) or in the animal world. The
rebirth-consciousness arising in the human plane or in one of the deva
planes is kusala vipākacitta; birth in these planes is a happy rebirth,
the result of kusala kamma.

Rebirth-consciousness arising in the human plane is
kusala vipāka, but there are different degrees of kamma producing kusala
vipāka. Those who are handicapped from the first moment of life have a
rebirth-consciousness that is the result of a very weak kusala kamma,
unaccompanied by the sobhana cetasikas of alobha, adosa and paññā. Since
the rebirth-consciousness of such a person is the result of weak kusala
kamma, akusala kamma has the opportunity to cause him to be troubled by
a handicap from the time of his birth.

As regards human beings who are not handicapped from the
first moment of their life, they are born in different surroundings:
they are born into different families, some of which are poor, some
rich; they are of different ranks; there are differences in the number
of their attendants or companions. All these varieties are due to a
cause, namely, the difference in strength of the kusala kamma that
produced as result the vipākacitta performing the function of rebirth.
If kusala kamma is accompanied by paññā of a low degree or unaccompanied
by paññā, it can produce as result rebirth-consciousness which is kusala
vipāka accompanied by sobhana cetasikas and the two hetus of alobha and
adosa. That person is then dvi-hetuka, born with a rebirth-consciousness
accompanied by two sobhana hetus but without paññā. In that life he
cannot attain jhāna nor enlightenment. 

When someone is born with a rebirth-consciousness
accompanied by paññā, as result of kamma accompanied by paññā, then he
is ti-hetuka, born with a rebirth-consciousness accompanied by the three
sobhana hetus of alobha, adosa and amoha or paññā. When that person
listens to the Dhamma, he is able to consider the Dhamma and to
understand it. In that life he can, if he develops paññā of the level of
samatha, attain jhāna. Or he can develop insight and, if the right
conditions have been accumulated, he can realize the four noble Truths
and attain enlightenment. Nevertheless, one should not be neglectful as
to the development of paññā. Someone may have been born with three
sobhana hetus and he may have accumulated sati and paññā, but if he
neglects developing kusala or listening to the Dhamma, he may only be
skilful as to worldly knowledge. If one does not develop insight, one
will not realize the characteristics of realities as they are.

In former lives, people may have been interested in the
Dhamma, they may have studied it and they may even have been ordained as
a bhikkhu or a novice. However, for the attainment of enlightenment it
is necessary for everybody to develop paññā, no matter whether he is a
bhikkhu or a lay follower. Nobody knows in what state of life, as a
bhikkhu or a layman, he will attain enlightenment. One must know as they
are the characteristics of realities that appear; paññā must be
developed life after life, until, during one life, it has become so keen
that it can penetrate the four noble Truths. 

In the past someone may have been interested in the
Dhamma and occupied with the study of the Dhamma and applied it in his
life, but one should never forget that so long as enlightenment has not
been attained, accumulated defilements can condition one to go astray.
Defilements are so persistent, so powerful, they can condition people to
be neglectful of kusala and to be engrossed in akusala. Someone may have
been born with a rebirth-consciousness that is ti-hetuka, with alobha,
adosa and paññā, but if he is neglectful and does not listen to the
Dhamma, if he does not consider it carefully and if he is not aware of
realities, there cannot be any development of paññā in that life. It is
to be regretted that someone born as ti-hetuka wastes his life by not
developing paññā. 

It is not sure which kamma will produce the
rebirth-consciousness of the next life. It may happen that akusala
vipākacitta will perform the function of rebirth in an unhappy plane, or
that ahetuka kusala vipākacitta will perform the function of rebirth, in
which case a person is handicapped from the first moment of life, or
that dvi-hetuka vipākacitta performs the function of rebirth in a happy
plane. In that case, someone is born without paññā and he is not able to
develop paññā to the degree that the four noble Truths can be realized
and enlightenment attained. Instead of neglecting the development of
paññā one should persevere with its development so that it can grow and
become keener.

When the rebirth-consciousness is sobhana citta, the
bhavanga-citta is also sobhana citta. A human being who is not born with
an ahetuka kusala vipākacitta, thus, who is not handicapped from birth,
has, when he is fast asleep, sobhana bhavanga-cittas. If he is born with
the two hetus of alobha and adosa, the bhavanga-cittas that are of the
same type as the rebirth-consciousness are also dvi-hetuka. If he is
born with the three hetus of alobha, adosa and paññā, the
bhavanga-cittas are ti-hetuka. When we are fast asleep, defilements do
not arise; we have no like or dislike, because we do not yet experience
objects through the sense-doors. We do not see, hear, smell, taste,
experience objects through the bodysense or think about different
objects. When we wake up, happiness or unhappiness arises due to the
different types of akusala cittas that arise in a day. When we are
awake, there are more asobhana cittas than kusala cittas.
Seeing-consciousness arises and sees what appears through the eyes just
for one moment and then there are usually akusala javana vīthi-cittas,
seven moments of them. Thus, javana citta arises seven times more than
seeing-consciousness that performs the function of seeing just for one
moment. A great deal of akusala dhammas has been accumulated from one
moment of citta to the next moment, day in day out. Therefore, we should
not be neglectful in the development of understanding while we study the
Dhamma the Buddha explained in detail. The Buddha explained which cittas
are sobhana, which cittas are asobhana and which of the asobhana cittas
are akusala, vipāka or kiriya. 

Questioner: Does the arahat have asobhana cittas?

Sujin: Yes, he has.

Questioner: Does the arahat have akusala cittas?

Sujin: No, he has not. The arahat has asobhana cittas
but he does not have akusala cittas. For the arahat the sense-cognitions
such as seeing or hearing arise, which are asobhana cittas, but he has
neither akusala cittas nor kusala cittas. 

There are fifty-two cetasikas in all: thirteen
aññasamāna cetasikas, which can be of four jātis and which are of the
same jāti as the citta and cetasikas they accompany, fourteen akusala
cetasikas and twenty-five sobhana cetasikas.[^203]

It is important to have right understanding of the
realities that are sobhana or asobhana. The Pāli term sobhana is often
translated into English as beautiful, but this word may cause
misunderstandings. One may believe that everything that is beautiful or
pleasant must be sobhana. One may for example think that pleasant bodily
feeling is sobhana, but this is not so. We should consider the reality
of pleasant bodily feeling. As we have seen, feelings can be classified
as fivefold:

- pleasant feeling, 
- unpleasant feeling, 
- indifferent feeling, 
- pleasant bodily feeling, 
- painful bodily feeling. 



Pleasant bodily feeling, sukha vedanā, accompanies
body-consciousness that is kusala vipāka, experiencing a pleasant
tangible object. Body-consciousness is not accompanied by the sobhana
cetasikas of alobha, adosa or paññā. Thus, the reality of pleasant
bodily feeling is asobhana, not sobhana. If we do not correctly
understand the Pāli terms that represent the different dhammas, we shall
have misunderstandings about them. 

We should know precisely which dhammas can be sobhana
and which dhammas cannot be sobhana. Rūpa cannot be sobhana dhamma,
although it can be a beautiful, pleasant object. Rūpa is the dhamma that
does not know anything; it can neither be kusala nor akusala. It cannot
be accompanied by kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy or any other
sobhana dhamma. Only citta and cetasika can be sobhana or asobhana. Rūpa
can be an object that conditions citta to arise and to like or dislike
it, but rūpa itself is indeterminate dhamma, avyākata dhamma. Rūpa does
not know that citta likes it or dislikes it. Rūpa itself has no
intention or wish to be liked or disliked by citta, since rūpa is not a
dhamma that can experience something. Citta experiences objects; it
wants to see visible object, to hear sound, to smell odour, to
experience pleasant tangible object, so that happy feeling can arise
again and again. One wants pleasant feeling every day, whenever objects
are experienced through the senses, or even whenever there is thinking
about all these objects. 

The five khandhas are objects of clinging, and this is
shown in different similes. In the commentary to the “Visuddhimagga”,
the “Paramattha Mañjūsa” (See Vis. XIV, 221, footnote 83)[^204]
it is said that rūpakkhandha is like a dish because it bears the food
which will bring happiness. Vedanākkhandha is like the food in that
dish. Saññākkhandha is like the curry sauce poured over the food that
enhances its flavour; because, owing to the perception of beauty it
hides the nature of the food that is feeling. Saṅkhārakkhandha is like
the server of the food being a cause of feeling. Viññāṇakkhandha is like
the eater, it is helped by feeling.

Citta is the leader in knowing an object. Citta and
cetasikas, the four nāmakkhandhas, must arise together, they know the
same object and they cannot be separated from each other. All four
nāmakkhandhas must arise together; there cannot be less than four
nāmakkhandhas. In the planes where there are five khandhas, the
nāmakkhandhas are dependent on rūpakkhandha, which conditions their
arising. 

We study the different types of citta so that we can
understand precisely the characteristics of cittas that can be
classified in different ways. They can be classified by way of the four
jātis, the four classes as to their nature of kusala, akusala, vipāka
and kiriya; by way of the three groups of kusala dhamma, akusala dhamma
and indeterminate dhamma, avyākata dhamma; by way of hetus; by way of
asaṅkhārika and sasaṅkhārika; by way of sobhana and asobhana. These
classifications make it clear to us that cittas are accompanied by
different cetasikas that cause them to be variegated. If we understand
these classifications it can be a condition for sati to arise and to be
aware of realities, so that they are known as anattā, not a self or a
being. They are just nāma and rūpa, each with their own characteristic,
appearing one at a time. Visible object appearing through the eyes is
one characteristic of reality, sound is another characteristic of
reality. Odour, flavour and tangible object are all different realities,
each with their own characteristic. Kusala citta and avyākata citta are
different realities each with their own characteristic.

If there is more understanding of all these realities
which each have their own characteristic, conditions are accumulated for
the arising of sati which can be aware and which can investigate the
characteristics of realities that appear. In this way, the true nature
of each dhamma can be penetrated.
