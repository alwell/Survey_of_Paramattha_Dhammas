## The Buddha

The Omniscient Buddha, the Exalted One, attained
parinibbāna, his final passing away, between the twin Sāla trees in the
Salwood, a place of recreation for the Mallas of the city of Kusināra.
From then on, the living beings in this world no longer had an
opportunity to hear the teaching of the Dhamma directly from the Buddha
himself. However, the Buddha left us the Dhamma and the Vinaya he had
taught and laid down as our teacher, representing him after he had
finally passed away.[^40]

The measure of regard and respect Buddhists have for the
Buddha’s excellent Dhamma is in accordance with the degree of their
knowledge and understanding of the Dhamma and Vinaya. Even if a man were
to see the outward appearance of the Buddha, emanating his excellence,
listen to the teaching of the Dhamma directly from him, or seize the hem
of his garment and walk behind him step by step, but did not understand
the Dhamma, he would not really see the Buddha. But if one sees and
understands the Dhamma, one is called a person who sees the
Tathāgata.[^41]

There are three levels of understanding of the Buddhist
teachings, the Dhamma as taught by the omniscient Buddha, namely:

- the level of pariyatti, or study of the Dhamma and Vinaya;

- the level of paṭipatti, or practice, the development of
 understanding of the Dhamma with the purpose to realize the Dhamma
 by which defilements are eradicated and the ceasing of dukkha is
 reached; 

- the level of paṭivedha, or penetration, the direct realization of
 the Dhamma by which the defilements are eradicated and the ceasing
 of dukkha is reached. 

The saying of the Buddha that whoever sees the Dhamma
sees the Tathāgata, refers to the seeing and realization of the Dhamma
the Buddha attained at the moment of his enlightenment. This is the
Dhamma consisting of the nine supramundane, or lokuttara,
dhammas.[^42] The direct realization of the Dhamma, which is the
level of paṭivedha, is the result of the practice, paṭipatti, the
development of the understanding of the Dhamma. The level of paṭipatti
must depend on pariyatti, the study of the Dhamma and the Vinaya. The
study is the refuge on which we depend, it is the way leading step by
step to the Dhamma of the level of paṭipatti, the practice, and then to
the Dhamma of the level of paṭivedha, the realization.

The Dhamma, the teaching of the Buddha, has been
preserved by memorizing and was passed on by oral tradition. It was
recited from memory as heard from the disciples who were arahats and who
had established the three parts of the teachings, called the Tipiṭaka at
the first Council, held shortly after the Buddha’s parinibbāna in
Rājagaha. The Dhamma was recited from memory and passed on until it was
committed to writing in the first century B.C. The Dhamma and Vinaya as
established at the Council by the disciples who were arahats consists of
three parts, namely:

- the Vinaya Piṭaka,

- the Suttanta Piṭaka,

- the Abhidhamma Piṭaka.


The Vinaya Piṭaka concerns mostly the rules of conduct
for the monks so that they can lead the “holy life” (brahma
cariya)[^43] perfectly, to the highest degree. The Suttanta
Piṭaka mostly concerns the principles of the Dhamma as preached to
different people at different places. The Abhidhamma Piṭaka deals with
the nature of dhammas, realities, and their interrelation by way of
cause and result.

The Buddha had realized the true nature of all realities
and also their interrelation, by way of cause and effect, through his
enlightenment. The Buddha explained the Dhamma, which he had realized
through his enlightenment, in order to help other beings living in this
world. In his incomparable wisdom, purity and compassion, he explained
the Dhamma from the time of his enlightenment until the time of his
parinibbāna, his final passing away. The Buddha fulfilled the
perfections in order to become the Perfectly Enlightened One, the
Arahat, the Sammāsambuddha.[^44] He was endowed with
extraordinary accomplishments (in Pāli, sampadā),[^45] and these
were the “accomplishment of cause” (hetu), the “accomplishment of
fruition” (phala) and the “accomplishment of assistance to other beings”
(sattupakāra)[^46].

As regards the “accomplishment of cause,” this is the
fulfilment of the right cause, namely the perfections necessary to
attain enlightenment and become the Sammāsambuddha.

As regards the “accomplishment of fruition,” this is the
attainment of four fruits or results that are the following
accomplishments: 

1. The accomplishment of wisdom (ñāṇa sampadā), the wisdom arising
 with the path-consciousness, at the moment of his
 enlightenment.[^47] This wisdom is the basis and root-cause
 of his omniscience and his ten powers[^48] (dasa bala).
2. The accomplishment of abandoning (pahāna sampadā). This is the
 complete eradication of all defilements, together with all
 accumulated tendencies for conduct which may not be agreeable,
 called in Pāli: vāsanā. Vāsanā is conduct through body or speech,
 which may not be agreeable and has been accumulated in the past.
 This disposition can only be eradicated by a
 Sammāsambuddha.[^49]
3. The accomplishment of power (ānubhāva sampadā), which is the power
 to achieve what one aspires to.
4. The accomplishment of physical excellence (rūpa-kāya sampadā).
 This consists of the special bodily characteristics manifesting his
 excellent qualities accumulated in the past[^50] and also,
 apart from these, other physical qualities, which were pleasing to
 the eye, impressive to all people, and which gave them joy.

When the cause, the perfections, has been fulfilled, it
is the condition for the accomplishment of fruition, the attainment of
enlightenment and becoming the Sammāsambuddha. Not just for his own sake
did he become the Sammāsambuddha, gaining freedom from dukkha
(suffering, inherent in the cycle of birth and death). He fulfilled the
perfections in order to attain enlightenment and acquire omniscience of
the Dhamma so that he could teach the Dhamma to the living beings in
this world who could also thereby become liberated from dukkha. If the
Buddha had fulfilled the perfections in order to eradicate defilements
and to become freed from dukkha only for his own sake, he could not be
called the Sammāsambuddha.

There are two kinds of Buddha: the Sammāsambuddha and
the Pacceka Buddha, or “Silent Buddha.”[^51]

As regards the Sammāsambuddha, he is someone who has
realized by his profound wisdom, all by himself, the truths concerning
all dhammas, which he had never heard before, and has attained
omniscience of those dhammas as well as mastery of special powers in the
field of knowledge.

As regards the Pacceka Buddha, he is someone who, by
himself, has thoroughly realized the truths concerning all dhammas,
which he had never heard before, but has not attained omniscience of
them, nor mastery of special powers in the field of knowledge.

Thus, the cause, the fulfilment of the perfections,
brings its result, which is the attainment of Buddhahood accordingly.
Cause and result are different for the Sammāsambuddha and for the
Pacceka Buddha.

The third accomplishment of the Buddha regards the
assistance to living beings (sattupakāra). This is the accomplishment of
constant assistance to the living beings of this world because of his
disposition and his efforts to do so. He wanted to help even people of
evil character such as Devadatta.[^52] In the case of people
whose faculty of understanding was not yet strong enough, the Buddha
waited with the teaching of Dhamma until the time was ripe for them. He
taught Dhamma with the sole purpose to help people to gain freedom from
all dukkha, without any consideration of gaining possessions, honour,
and so on, for himself.

When the Sammāsambuddha had fulfilled the accomplishment
of cause and the accomplishment of fruition, he was ready to help those
who were receptive to his teaching, to be freed from dukkha, and this
was the accomplishment of assistance to other beings. Thus, he was the
Sammāsambuddha because he fulfilled the three accomplishments of cause,
of fruition and of assistance to other beings.

Therefore, the Dhamma that the Sammāsambuddha taught is
the Dhamma he completely penetrated when he attained enlightenment.
Through the realization of the Dhamma at the time of his enlightenment,
his defilements were completely eradicated. The Buddha taught the Dhamma
he had realized himself so that those who practised the Dhamma
accordingly would also become free from defilements.

The followers of the Buddha should investigate and study
the truth of the Dhamma that the Buddha realized through his
enlightenment, in order to find out what this truth exactly is. In which
way is the truth the Buddha realized different from the truth of the
conventional world?

The Buddha realized the truth through his enlightenment
and taught it to his followers so that they too would have understanding
and practise the Dhamma accordingly until they would realize the truth
themselves. The truth the Buddha taught is that everything which appears
is a type of dhamma,[^53] a reality that is not self, not a
being, not a person. All dhammas that arise do so because there are
conditions for their arising, such as attachment, anger, regret, unhappy
feeling, happy feeling, jealousy, avarice, loving-kindness, compassion,
seeing, hearing; all of these are different types of dhammas. There are
different kinds of dhammas because they arise on account of different
conditions.

One erroneously takes attachment, anger, and other
dhammas that arise, for self, for a being, for a person, and that is
wrong view, wrong understanding. It is wrong understanding because those
dhammas, after they have arisen, fall away, disappear, are subject to
change all the time, from birth to death. The reason for erroneously
taking dhammas for self, a being or a person, is ignorance of the truth
about dhammas.

Whenever one sees, one takes the seeing, which is a kind
of dhamma, for self; one clings to the idea of “I am seeing.” When one
hears, one takes the dhamma that hears for self; one clings to the idea
of “I am hearing.” When one smells, one takes the dhamma that smells for
self; one clings to the idea of “I am smelling.” When one tastes, one
takes the dhamma that tastes for self; one clings to the idea of “I am
tasting.” When one experiences tangible object through the bodysense,
one takes the dhamma that experiences this for self, one clings to the
idea of “I am experiencing.” When one thinks of different subjects, one
takes the dhamma that thinks for self; one clings to the idea of “I am
thinking.”

After the Buddha had realized through his enlightenment
the truth of all dhammas, he taught this truth to his followers so that
they too would understand that dhammas are not self, not a being, not a
person. He taught about paramattha dhammas, ultimate realities, each
with its own characteristic that is unalterable. The characteristics of
paramattha dhammas cannot be changed by anybody, whether he knows them
or does not know them, whether he calls them by a name in whatever
language, or does not call them by a name. Their characteristics are
always the same. The dhammas that arise do so because there are the
appropriate conditions for their arising and then they fall away. Just
as the Buddha said to the venerable Ānanda,[^54] “Whatever has
arisen, has come into being because of conditions, is by nature subject
to dissolution.”

Because of ignorance, one has wrong understanding and
takes the dhammas that arise and fall away for self, a being or a
person. This is the cause of desire and ever growing infatuation with
one’s rank, title or status, with one’s birth, one’s family, the colour
of one’s skin and so on. In reality, what one sees are only different
colours appearing through the eyes, not self, not a being, not a person.
The sound one hears is not self, not a being, not a person. What appears
through the senses are only different kinds of dhammas that arise
because of their appropriate conditions.

The wrong view that takes dhammas for self, a being or a
person, has been compared to the perception of a mirage. People who are
travelling in the desert may perceive a mirage of water ahead of them,
but when they come close the mirage disappears because in reality there
is no water. The mirage they perceived was a deception, an optical
illusion. Even so is the wrong understanding that takes dhammas for
self, a being or a person, a deception caused by ignorance, by wrong
perception or remembrance, and by wrong belief.

Words such as being, person, woman or man are only
concepts used to designate what we see or hear. Moreover, it is evident
that the different colours, sounds, odours, cold, heat, softness,
hardness, motion or pressure could not appear if there were no dhammas
that can experience them, namely, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting,
experiencing cold, heat, softness, hardness, motion or pressure, knowing
the meaning of the different things and thinking.

The dhammas that can experience different things, such
as the dhamma which experiences colour, the dhamma which experiences
sound, the dhammas which experience odour, flavour, cold, heat,
softness, hardness, motion, pressure, the dhamma which knows the meaning
of the different things and the dhamma which thinks about different
subjects, all these dhammas, experiencing different things, have been
classified by the Sammāsambuddha as citta, consciousness.
