## The Characteristic of Dukkha

Questioner: What should a layman do who wants to be free
from dukkha? He may see that there is such a great deal of dukkha, that
it is so terrible and that it occurs all the time, because people are
born and they have to be born again and again. Is there a short way to
become free from dukkha?

Sujin: When someone says that there is such a great deal
of dukkha, that it is so terrible, there is bound to be wrong view that
clings to the concept of self. Only if there is no wrong view of self
can dukkha become less. The Buddha explained that all the different
kinds of dukkha can be eliminated according as defilements are
eradicated stage by stage. So long as defilements have not been
eradicated, there have to be countless rebirths. So long as there is
birth, there is dukkha. The sotāpanna who has attained the first stage
of enlightenment and has eradicated defilements in accordance with that
stage, will not be reborn more than seven times. We read in the “Kindred
Sayings” (II, Nidāna vagga, Ch XIII, § 1, The Tip of the Nail):

> “Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying
near Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

> Then the Exalted One took up a little pinch of dust on the tip of his
finger-nail and said to the monks: ‘What do you think, monks? Whether is
this pinch of dust that I have taken up on my finger-nail the greater,
or the mighty earth?’

> ‘The latter, lord, the mighty earth is the greater. Infinitely small is
this pinch of dust taken up by the Exalted One on his finger-nail, not
by a hundredth part, nor by a thousandth part, not by a hundred
thousandth part does it equal the mighty earth when set beside it – this
pinch of dust taken up by the Exalted One on his finger-nail.’

> ‘Even so, monks, for the ariyan disciple who has won vision, for the
person who has understanding this is the greater dukkha, to wit, that
which for him is wholly perished, wholly finished; little is the dukkha
that remains, not worth the hundredth part, not worth the thousandth
part, not worth the hundred thousandth part when measured with the
former dukkha which for him is wholly perished, wholly finished, to wit,
a term of seven times.[^327] 

> So great in good, monks, is it to be wise in the Dhamma; so great a good
is it to have gained the eye of the Dhamma.’ ”

> Since the number of rebirths of ordinary people, who
have not attained enlightenment, is countless, the dukkha that arises
because of birth must be immeasurable.

Questioner: We all want to know what to do so that we
can begin now with the practice of vipassanā.

Sujin: One should be aware of the characteristic of the
reality that appears. When sati is aware of whatever reality appears,
vitakka cetasika which is “right thinking”, sammā-sankappa of the
eightfold Path, touches or “hits” the characteristic of the object which
is appearing. At that moment, paññā can begin to study and gradually to
realize the true nature of that object. In that way paññā can develop.

Understanding can arise and develop when sati is aware
of the characteristics of realities that appear and these are considered
and investigated at that moment. The realities that arise and appear
fall away very rapidly. Paññā may not be keen enough yet to consider and
study those realities. For example, when there is hearing, sati may
arise and be aware of hearing, just for a moment, but there may not be
paññā yet that is sufficiently keen to investigate that characteristic
in order to know it as only a nāma which experiences sound. The nāma
that hears has completely fallen away. In the beginning there is not yet
clear understanding of realities such as hearing, but this is quite
normal. Nobody can investigate the true nature of sound and of the nāma
that hears by trying to catch them or to get hold of them. However, the
nāma that hears will surely arise again and if one develops sati and
paññā, there can be awareness again of the nāma that hears.

Now, at this moment, sati can arise and be aware of one
characteristic of nāma or rūpa at a time, as it appears through one of
the six doorways. In this way paññā can gradually develop to the degree
of clearly knowing the difference between the characteristic of nāma and
the characteristic of rūpa. Paññā will, for example, be able to
distinguish between the characteristics of the nāma that hears and of
the rūpa that is sound. These are different characteristics and they
should be known one at a time. Eventually one will become more familiar
with the true nature of nāma and of rūpa and then the understanding of
their characteristics will become more accomplished. No matter which
type of nāma or rūpa appears, and no matter where, awareness and
understanding of them can naturally arise, and that is the development
of satipaṭṭhāna in daily life. When understanding develops and becomes
more accomplished, ignorance can gradually be eliminated. 

Questioner: After one has paid respect to the Buddha by
chanting texts, one may wish to sit and concentrate on a meditation
subject. How can one do that with wise attention, so that there is no
attachment or aversion with regard to the meditation subject? 

Sujin: When there is right mindfulness, sammā-sati, of
the eightfold Path, there truly is wise attention. It is not necessary
to sit and concentrate on a meditation subject. When someone believes
that he should sit and concentrate with the purpose of having sati, he
has the wrong understanding that there is a self who could make sati
arise at a fixed time. However, sammā-sati does not have to wait until
one has paid respect by chanting texts. Who is paying respect to the
Buddha? If someone does not know that it is nāma and rūpa, he takes the
realities at that moment for self. He has an idea of, “I am paying
respect”, he clings to an idea of self who chants texts. Sammā-sati can
arise and be aware of any reality that appears when we are paying
respect or chanting texts, or at other moments, no matter which posture
we assume. 

Bhikkhu: I have a question on satipaṭṭhāna. I have read
that among the twenty-eight rūpas, there are rūpas that cannot be seen,
rūpas that cannot impinge, subtle rūpas, rūpas that are far, and so on.
Could you explain about this?

Sujin: There is only one rūpa among the twenty-eight
rūpas that can be seen, and that is visible object that appears through
the eyesense. Visible object can be seen and it is among the rūpas that
impinge or contact (sappaṭigha rūpas)[^328]. There are other
rūpas that can impinge: the sense objects, apart from visible object,
which are sound, odour, flavour and tangible object, consisting of
solidity (appearing as hardness or softness), temperature (appearing as
heat or cold) and motion (appearing as motion or pressure). Furthermore,
there are the senses that can be contacted or impinged on, namely,
eyesense, earsense, smelling-sense, tasting-sense and bodysense. These
eleven rūpas can impinge or can be impinged on, but they cannot be seen,
whereas visible object can impinge and can be seen.[^329] The
twelve rūpas that can impinge are coarse rūpas. They are also called
rūpas that are “near”, because they can be investigated and known. 

The sixteen other rūpas among the twenty-eight rūpas are
the subtle rūpas. They cannot be seen nor are they impinging. Subtle
rūpas are “far”, they cannot easily be discerned. 

The dhammas the Buddha explained are true and people who
develop satipaṭṭhāna can verify them; they can know the characteristics
of the dhammas that naturally appear, just as they are. However, the
Dhamma is subtle and deep. For example, when a person learns that
visible object is the reality appearing through the eyes, he may think
that it is not difficult to understand this. But theoretical
understanding is not the same as understanding of the characteristic of
seeing when he sees. If he does not develop satipaṭṭhāna so that paññā
becomes keener, he cannot realize the characteristics of nāma and rūpa
as they are. When one sees, visible object is experienced through the
eyes, but what one sees one takes for people, beings and different
things. Then doubt arises and people wonder what visible object is like,
what characteristic it has.

Visible object is the reality that appears when our eyes
are open and there is seeing, not yet thinking about anything. Then the
characteristic of visible object can appear naturally, as it is. As
paññā develops, one can become familiar with the fact that visible
object which appears is not a being, person, self or anything else.
Visible object is only the reality that appears through the eyes, that
is its true nature. If people are not inclined to study and investigate
the characteristic of visible object, it will be impossible for them to
relinquish clinging to the idea they used to have of seeing people,
beings or different things.

Questioner: What is the meaning of studying realities?

Sujin: There is this kind of study when sati is aware
and considers the characteristic of whatever reality appears. That
reality can be known as nāma, which experiences something, or as rūpa
which does not experience anything. This is the study of the
characteristic of non-self of the reality that appears and it is
different from merely thinking of words or naming realities. When paññā
has become more accomplished, it can penetrate the three general
characteristics of nāma and rūpa: impermanence, dukkha and anattā. 

Questioner: When my eyes are open I am seeing, but I do
not pay attention to anything else. Is this correct? 

Sujin: We cannot prevent the arising and falling away of
cittas which succeed one another, that is their nature. When sati
arises, it can be aware of whatever reality appears naturally, just as
it is. 

Questioner: For most people the aim of the development
of satipaṭṭhāna is to become free from dukkha. When paññā has arisen,
one is free from dukkha. 

Sujin: Freedom from dukkha cannot be realized easily.
Paññā should first be developed stage by stage, so that ignorance, doubt
and wrong view that takes realities for self can be eliminated. If
people develop sati and paññā naturally, they will know that paññā grows
very gradually, because ignorance arises many more times a day than
kusala. This was so in past lives and it is also like this in the
present life. 

Questioner: The problem is that when an object impinges
on one of the doorways I am bound to be forgetful, I lack sati. 

Sujin: That is quite normal. When sati is still weak, it
cannot arise immediately. 

Questioner: I have studied the texts the monks chant in
the morning, about the khandhas of clinging, upadāna khandhas. There is
clinging to the five khandhas and this is dukkha. What does this mean?

Sujin: The five khandhas of clinging are certainly
dukkha. So long as there is ignorance of the true nature of the dhammas
that appear, there is bound to be happiness and sorrow. The arising of
happiness and sorrow is a kind of dukkha, because at such moments there
is no calm, no freedom from defilements. When paññā does not arise, the
difference between kusala citta and akusala citta is not known. We all
enjoy having lobha. There is no end to the enjoyment of lobha, until
paññā discerns the difference between the moment of kusala, when there
is non-attachment, and the moment of lobha, when there is pleasure,
amusement, desire, enjoyment or clinging.

When paññā does not arise, we enjoy defilements, we like
to have lobha; it never is enough, no matter whether we experience an
object through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the bodysense
or the mind-door. Generally, people do not know that such moments are
dukkha, that they are harmful and dangerous. Thus, the five khandhas of
clinging are dukkha.

Questioner: When we are heedful when objects are
impinging, for example, when visible object contacts the eye or sound
contacts the ear, there will be neither happiness nor sorrow. 

Sujin: There is not “somebody” or a “self” who could be
heedful or force the arising of sati. When sati arises, we can know the
difference between the moment with sati and the moment without sati.

Questioner: The five khandhas of the ordinary person
must be the same as those of the arahat, but the khandhas of the
ordinary person are still objects of clinging and this causes the
arising of dukkha. When we gradually learn to be heedful when sense
objects such as visible object or sound are impinging on the relevant
doorways, do we develop satipaṭṭhāna in the right way?

Sujin: One should remember that all dhammas are anattā,
non-self, so that sati can be developed in the right way. One should
know when there is sati and when there is no sati. When one has a
concept of self who is heedful, satipaṭṭhāna is not developed.

Questioner: The word anattā is difficult to understand.
We can translate the Pāli term attā as self and the term anattā as
non-self, but we do not really understand the meaning of these terms. We
may say that there is no self, but we still cling to the concept of
self. 

Sujin: What is the self? 

Questioner: We may assume that we are the “self,” but
the Buddha states that there are only the five khandhas that arise
together.

Sujin: The khandhas are not a person, not a self, but if
we do not know that there are only the khandhas, we assume that there is
a self. 

Questioner: Although we know this, we still think, when
we are seeing, that a self is seeing.

Sujin: That is so because we do not yet have clear
comprehension of the true characteristics of the khandhas as realities
which arise and fall away very rapidly. They can be classified in
different ways, namely, as past, present and future; as coarse and
subtle; as internal and external; as far and near, and so on. If one can
discern the characteristics of the khandhas, one will know that each
characteristic of reality that arises and falls away is only
rūpakkhandha (physical phenomena), vedanākkhandha (feeling),
saññākkhandha (remembrance or perception), saṅkhārakkhandha (formations
or activities, all cetasikas other than vedanā and saññā) or
viññāṇakkhandha (consciousness). 

Questioner: I have heard that the postures conceal
dukkha. Please, could you explain this?

Sujin: All conditioned realities have the characteristic
of dukkha. They arise and fall away, they are impermanent and therefore,
they cannot be a real refuge, they are dukkha. Thus, dukkha is not
merely painful feeling. When it is said that the postures conceal
dukkha, one should understand that this refers not just to painful
feeling but to the characteristic of dukkha inherent in all conditioned
realities. One may believe that there is no dukkha when, at this very
moment, one is sitting, lying down, standing or walking without being
stiff. The belief that the change of one posture into another one
conceals dukkha is not paññā that clearly realizes the arising and
falling away of nāma dhammas and rūpa dhammas. Nāma and rūpa arise
together when one assumes different postures and dukkha is concealed so
long as one does not know the characteristic of dukkha of one rūpa and
of one nāma at a time, as they arise and fall away.

When one asks people who have just assumed a new posture
whether there is dukkha, they will answer that there is not. If they
confuse painful feeling with the truth of dukkha, how can they
understand that the postures conceal dukkha? There must be dukkha,
otherwise it cannot be said that the postures conceal dukkha. Any idea
of a posture or of the whole body, no matter there is painful feeling or
not, conceals the characteristic of dukkha. So long as one has not
realized the arising and falling away of nāma and rūpa one does not
understand the truth of dukkha.

If a person does not develop paññā in order to
understand nāma and rūpa as they are, he has wrong understanding of
dukkha. He may believe that he knows the truth of dukkha when he ponders
over his painful feeling, dukkha vedanā, caused by stiffness, before he
changes into a new posture in order to relieve his pain. He cannot know
the truth of dukkha so long as he does not discern the characteristic of
non-self of nāma and rūpa. This is the case if he does not know the nāma
which sees and colour appearing through the eyes, the nāma which hears
and sound appearing through the ears, the nāma which smells and odour,
the nāma which tastes and flavour, the nāma which experiences tangible
object and tangible object, the nāma which thinks, happiness, sorrow and
other realities. 

Also, the reality which thinks that it will change
posture is not self, it should be realized as a type of nāma which
arises and then falls away. If one does not know this, one will not be
able to understand the characteristic of dukkha. Only if one is
naturally aware of nāma and rūpa as they appear one at a time, paññā can
develop stage by stage, so that the noble Truth of dukkha can be
realized. 

Questioner: When there is sati, it seems that only
dukkha appears, but I cannot separate nāma and rūpa when I experience
objects through the senses and through the mind-door. I just have
theoretical knowledge of different realities that appear one at a time
through the different doorways. I went to a meditation centre to gain
more knowledge about the practice, but I did not study a great deal, I
just practised.

Sujin: Are you satisfied with your understanding or not
yet?

 Questioner: I am still studying, thus, I cannot say
that I am satisfied.

Sujin: You said that you went to a meditation centre in
order to study and practise. However, when you went there you did not
gain much understanding of realities. Is it then of any use to go there?

Questioner: It is useful. When we are at home, usually
many akusala cittas arise. If we go to a meditation centre, we meet the
right friend in Dhamma and we are in a quiet, peaceful place. Thus,
there are conditions for the arising of many kusala cittas. I think that
a meditation centre is useful. 

Sujin: There are four factors necessary to attain the
stage of the sotāpanna: meeting the right friend in Dhamma, hearing the
Dhamma from that person, considering the Dhamma one heard with wise
attention and the practice in conformity with the Dhamma. These factors
are not related to a particular place where one should stay. We can
compare the place where the Buddha stayed with the meditation centre at
the present time. As to the place where the Buddha and the monks stayed
in the past, they led their daily life, making their rounds to collect
almsfood, discussing the Dhamma, and performing their different duties
in accordance with the Vinaya. The Buddha exhorted people there to
perform all kinds of wholesome deeds. Do people in the present time who
go to a meditation centre practise in the same way as the Buddha’s
followers in the past or do they practise differently? If the cause,
that is, the practice, is different, how could the result be the same?
For example, Anāthapiṇḍika, a lay follower at the Buddha’s time who had
the Great Monastery (Mahā-vihāra) of the Jeta Grove constructed, did not
have the wrong understanding that one could become enlightened only at
that particular place. Layfollowers at that time attained enlightenment
each in different places, depending on their daily life. 

We read in the “Gradual Sayings”(III, Book of the Fives,
Ch XIX, §1, Forest-gone) that the Buddha said to the monks:

> “Monks, these five are forest-gone. What five? One is forest-gone out of
folly and blindness; one out of evil desires and longings; one foolish
and mind-tossed; one at the thought: ‘It is praised by Buddhas and their
disciples’; and one is forest-gone just because his wants are little,
just for contentment, just to mark (his own faults),[^330] just
for seclusion, just because it is the very thing.[^331] 

> Verily, monks, of these five who have gone to the forest, he who has
gone just because his wants are little, for contentment, to mark (his
own faults), for seclusion, just because it is the very thing–he of the
five is topmost, best, foremost, highest, elect.

> Monks, just as from the cow comes milk, from milk cream, from cream
butter, from butter ghee, from ghee the skim of ghee which is reckoned
topmost; even so, monks, of these five forest-gone, he who has gone just
because his wants are little, for contentment, to mark (his own faults),
for seclusion, and just because it is the very thing–he of the five is
topmost, best, foremost, highest, elect.”

Why were some monks dwelling in the forest out of folly
and blindness? Some people think that once they are in the forest they
will be able to realize the four noble Truths. Are those who think thus
not forest dwellers out of folly and blindness? If a person has right
understanding of cause and effect, he will see that no way of life was
more excellent than the life of the monk who had left the householder’s
life in order to go to the place where the Buddha dwelt. This is
altogether different from someone’s life in a meditation centre where he
goes just for a short period, out of desire to attain enlightenment.
Some people believe that staying in a centre for the practice of
vipassanā, although it is not in conformity with their nature, will be
the condition to realize the noble Truths. If that were true, then
laypeople who practise vipassanā in a meditation centre should deserve
more praise than the monks in the Buddha’s time who were leading their
ordinary daily life in accordance with the rules of the Vinaya, such as
going on their alms rounds, listening to the Dhamma and discussing it,
and performing the different duties of the Sangha. 

Questioner: I understand that a certain way of life does
not conform to a person’s nature. If he would force himself to act
against his nature that would not be right, is that not so?

Sujin: People should consider cause and effect in the
right way. A great number of monks did not live in a forest. The Buddha
did not force people to develop satipaṭṭhāna in a forest, in a specific
room, or in any other place where they were free from the performing of
their tasks. It is true that the Buddha praised the forest life, that he
praised a secluded life or whatever else was a condition for the
non-arising of lobha, dosa and moha. However, he did not force anybody,
he did not establish rules for the development of paññā. The Buddha
clearly knew the different accumulations of people and, thus, he
preached the Dhamma in such a way that his followers would listen and
develop right understanding naturally. Thus, they would be able to
eliminate defilements. He taught people the development of satipaṭṭhāna
in their daily life, in conformity with their status, no matter whether
they were monk or layfollower. 

When awareness arises and one begins to consider and
study the characteristics of nāma and rūpa so that paññā becomes more
accomplished, one’s inclinations can gradually be changed. People will
be less overcome by lobha, dosa and moha on account of the objects
experienced through the sense-doors and through the mind-door. However,
accumulated inclinations cannot be changed on the spur of the moment.
Some people think that a meditation centre should not be repainted,
because that would be a condition for lobha. However, when they return
to their homes after they have stayed in the centre, they have their
houses repainted, they plant trees and look after their flowers, thus,
they follow their accumulated inclinations. 

The Buddha taught true Dhamma (sacca Dhamma), so that
people could have right understanding of cause and effect with regard to
all realities. He taught the development of satipaṭṭhāna so that paññā
could become accomplished to the degree of eradicating latent
tendencies. Latent tendencies have been accumulated from past lives on
to the present life in the cittas that arise and fall away in an
uninterrupted succession. Ignorance (avijjā), not knowing the
characteristics of nāma and rūpa, and wrong view, diṭṭhi, which takes
nāma and rūpa for self, are latent tendencies.

One takes all kinds of realities for self, no matter
whether one sees, hears, tastes, smells, experiences tangible object,
thinks, feels happy or unhappy. The only way leading to the eradication
of latent tendencies is the development of satipaṭṭhāna. This is
awareness and investigation of the realities that appear so that they
can be understood more clearly. Understanding is developed stage by
stage. When paññā is developed to the degree of the first stage of
insight, “the defining of nāma and rūpa” (nāma-rūpa-pariccheda-ñāṇa),
paññā can clearly comprehend the difference between the characteristic
of nāma and of rūpa appearing at that moment.

Paññā cannot be developed if one tries to make dukkha
arise by sitting, lying down, standing or walking for a long time, so
that one has painful feeling. Paññā can only be developed by considering
and studying with awareness nāma and rūpa as they naturally appear
through the senses and through the mind-door. They arise because of
their own conditions, no matter where one is.
