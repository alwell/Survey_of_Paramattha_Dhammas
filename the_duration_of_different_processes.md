## The Duration of Different Processes


When we see and we are then attached to visible object
and enjoy it, it seems that it is just “normal” attachment, which is not
harmful. However, we should realize that even “normal” attachment is a
dhamma that is harmful. Its result is suffering, dukkha, and little by
little the conditions are being accumulated for more dukkha later on. It
is true that dukkha does not occur immediately when there is just a
slight amount of attachment. However, when attachment is accumulated
more and more, it becomes powerful and it can reach the degree of a
“hindrance” (nīvaraṇa), a defilement that obstructs kusala, which causes
worry and is oppressive. Then the characteristic of heaviness is
evident, the heaviness of akusala, the dhamma that is restless, not
calm. 

We can find out for ourselves whether, throughout the
whole day, from the time we wake up until we go to sleep, the
javana-cittas arise more often in a series of akusala cittas or in a
series of kusala cittas. What can be done to cure us of akusala? In
fact, we are all taking poison, the poison of akusala, and when we
realize this we should look for the right medicine for a cure. If we do
not realize that we are taking poison, we will accumulate the
inclination to take it. Its harmful effects will gradually increase,
evermore. There is only one medicine that can cure us, the development
of right

understanding of realities, of satipaṭṭhāna. If sati of satipaṭṭhāna
does not arise, there is no way to become free from the accumulation of
akusala. Akusala will be accumulated evermore and there will not be much
opportunity for the arising of different types of wholesomeness.
Whereas, when one develops satipaṭṭhāna, it can arise instead of
akusala, and votthapana-citta (determining-consciousness arising just
before the javana-cittas) can then be contiguity-condition
(anantara-paccaya)[^124] for the arising of kusala cittas
according to one’s accumulations. Kusala citta can be accompanied by the
degree of sati that is mindful of the reality that is appearing.

The javana vīthi-cittas that are kusala, and those that
are akusala, arise and fall away in succession and they accumulate
kusala or akusala all the time. This conditions each person to have
different inclinations, a different character and different behaviour.
The accumulations in the citta of each person are most intricate. Also
the arahats, those who have reached perfection, have different
inclinations; they excel in different qualities. Venerable Sāriputta was
pre-eminent in wisdom, venerable Mahā Moggallāna in superpowers,
venerable Mahā Kassapa in the observance of ascetical practices, which
he also encouraged others to observe, and venerable Anuruddha was
pre-eminent in clairvoyance. The javana vīthi-cittas of each one of us
arrange themselves in their own series or sequence and accumulate
different kinds of kusala and akusala time and again. This is the reason
that, at the present time, we all think, speak and act in completely
different ways. 

Cittas that are kusala, akusala and mahā-kiriya, which
arrange themselves in a series of javana, cause people to have a
different behaviour through body and speech. It could happen that people
who saw an arahat had contempt for him because they judged him by his
outward behaviour, which he had accumulated for an endlessly long time.
The Brahman Vassakāra, the Prime Minister of Magadha, for example, made
a serious mistake by misjudging an arahat from his outward behaviour.
When he saw Mahā Kacchana coming down from a mountain, he said that Mahā
Kacchana behaved like a monkey. Vassakāra’s haughtiness was conditioned
by the accumulation of his javana vīthi-cittas. The Buddha told him to
ask for Mahā Kacchana’s forgiveness, but his accumulated conceit was the
condition that made him unable to do so. The Buddha predicted that
Vassakāra, after he had died, would be reborn as a monkey in a bamboo
wood. Vassakāra had thereupon banana trees planted as well as other
things monkeys could eat. Then his food would be all ready for him when
he was to be reborn as a monkey in that bamboo wood.

We should see the danger of the accumulation of akusala
in the javana vīthi-cittas that arise and fall away in a succession of
seven cittas. Akusala is accumulated time and again so that it becomes
one’s nature and appears in one’s behaviour and speech and this
accumulated behaviour is called “vāsanā”[^125] in Pāli. Even
when one has become an arahat, there are inclinations accumulated in the
citta that condition different kinds of behaviour. The Buddha is the
only person who could eradicate “vāsanā.” All arahats have eradicated
defilements completely so that not even a germ is left of them, but
nevertheless, they are unable to eradicate “vāsanā.” This is because
they have accumulated “vāsanā” for an endlessly long time in the cycle
of birth and death through the power of the javana vīthi-cittas. 

Summarising the different types of vīthi-cittas in the
five-sense-door process, they are the following seven types:

1. The first vīthi-citta is the five-sense-door
 adverting-consciousness, pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta. 

2. The second vīthi-citta is one of the five pairs[^126] of
 sense-cognitions, dvi-pañca-viññāṇas, which are
 seeing-consciousness, hearing-consciousness, smelling-consciousness,
 tasting-consciousness and body-consciousness. 
3. The third vīthi-citta is the receiving-consciousness,
 sampaṭicchana-citta, that receives the object from the preceding
 citta, one of the sense-cognitions, after this has fallen away. 
4. The fourth vīthi-citta is the investigating-consciousness,
 santīraṇa-citta, which examines and considers the object. 
5. The fifth vīthi-citta is the determining-consciousness,
 votthapana-citta, which performs the function of determining whether
 it will be succeeded by kusala citta, akusala citta or kiriyacitta
 (in the case of the arahat). 
6. The sixth type of vīthi-citta is the javana vīthi-citta of which
 there are usually seven types in succession. Javana can be
 translated as impulsion or “running.” It goes quickly through the
 object with kusala citta, akusala citta or kiriyacitta. 
7. The seventh type of vīthi-citta is the tadārammaṇa vīthi-citta
 (tadārammaṇa means: “that object”) or tadālambana vīthi-citta
 (ālambana means delaying, hanging on). This citta is called in
 English retention or registering-consciousness. It performs the
 function of receiving the object, hanging on to the object after the
 javana-cittas, if the object has not yet fallen away, since rūpa
 lasts no longer than seventeen moments of citta. 



The following summary shows the duration of an object
that is rūpa, lasting as long as seventeen moments of citta:

- When a rūpa arises and impinges on a sense-base, the first moment
 of citta that arises and falls away is the bhavanga-citta that is
 called past bhavanga, atīta-bhavanga. 
- The vibrating bhavanga, bhavanga calana, is the second moment of
 citta. 
- The arrest bhavanga, bhavangupaccheda, is the third moment of
 citta. 
- The five-sense-door adverting-consciousness is the fourth moment
 of citta. 
- One of the sense-cognitions is the fifth moment of citta.
- The receiving-consciousness is the sixth moment of citta.
- The investigating-consciousness is the seventh moment of citta. 
- The determining-consciousness is the eighth moment of citta. 
- The first javana-citta is the ninth moment of citta. 
- The second javana-citta is the tenth moment of citta. 
- The third javana-citta is the eleventh moment of citta. 
- The fourth javana-citta is the twelfth moment of citta. 
- The fifth javana-citta is the thirteenth moment of citta.
- The sixth javana-citta is the fourteenth moment of citta.
- The seventh javana-citta is the fifteenth moment of citta. 



From the moment of atīta bhavanga when the rūpa that is
the object arose, fifteen moments have passed when the seventh
javana-citta has fallen away. Thus, there are still two more moments
left before the rūpa will fall away, since in comparison with the
duration of nāma, rūpa lasts seventeen times longer. People who are born
in the sensuous planes of existence have accumulated kamma in the past
that is connected with visible object, sound, odour, flavour and
tangible object, the sense objects. When the javana-cittas “run through”
a sense object and it has not fallen away yet, kamma conditions the
arising of vipākacitta after the javana-cittas in the form of
tadālambana-citta, retention, which “hangs on” to the object. This is in
accordance with the nature of those born in sensuous planes. The
tadālambana-citta receives the object after the javana-cittas and there
are two types of this citta in succession.

The tadālambana-citta is the last vīthi-citta that
performs its function in a process and experiences the object through
the corresponding doorway. Then bhavanga-cittas arise again, succeeding
one another, until vīthi-cittas of a new process arise and experience an
object through one of the doorways. 

At the moment of bhavanga-citta, this world does not
appear. There is no remembrance connected with the different people and
the events of this world. The situation is the same as when one is fast
asleep and one is not aware of anything that has to do with this world.
At the moments one is fast asleep, and also in between processes, there
are just bhavanga-cittas arising and falling away. The
rebirth-consciousness, paṭisandhi-citta, the bhavanga-citta and the
dying-consciousness, cuti-citta, are not vīthi-cittas, they do not
experience an object through one of the six doors.[^127] The
dying-consciousness is the last citta of this lifespan; it performs the
function of passing away from one’s life as a particular individual. It
is succeeded by the rebirth-consciousness of the next life, and then
again there are vīthi-cittas experiencing objects connected with the
world of the next life, which is different. So long as the
dying-consciousness has not arisen, we are still leading this life.
Besides the bhavanga-cittas that do not know anything connected with
this world, there have to be again vīthi-cittas which know objects of
this world, namely, visible object, sound, odour, flavour, tangible
object, objects experienced through the mind-door and different ideas
connected with this world.

The duration of one rūpa is equal to the arising and falling away of
seventeen moments of citta.

After the vīthi-cittas of a sense-door process have
arisen, experienced an object through one of the five sense-doors (which
is the pasāda-rūpa) and have fallen away, there will be bhavanga-cittas
arising and falling away in succession, in between processes. After
that, the mind-door adverting-consciousness arises and experiences
through the mind-door (the bhavangupaccheda) the same object as the
vīthi-cittas of the preceding sense-door process, which just before
experienced that object and then fell away. The process of cittas that
experience an object through the mind-door does not last as long as a
sense-door process. There is no atīta bhavanga before the mind-door
process begins. The object that has just been experienced by cittas of a
sense-door process no longer impinges on the eyesense or one of the
other senses when the mind-door process begins. There have to be
bhavanga-cittas before the mind-door process and the last
bhavanga-cittas that arise and fall away are the bhavanga calana that
vibrates, that is stirred by the object, and the bhavangupaccheda, the
arrest bhavanga. 

After this citta has fallen away, the mind-door
adverting-consciousness arises and this is the first vīthi-citta of the
mind-door process, which experiences the same object as the cittas of
the sense-door process. The mind-door adverting-consciousness, which
performs the function of adverting to the object through the mind-door,
is different from the five-sense-door adverting-consciousness, which
performs its function only through five sense-doors. The mind-door
adverting-consciousness “ponders over” the object and experiences it
through the mind-door. Whenever we think about different subjects, as we
do time and again, the citta at such moments does not experience objects
through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue and the bodysense.

After the bhavanga calana, the bhavangupaccheda and the
mind-door adverting-consciousness have arisen and fallen away, kusala
cittas or akusala cittas arise in the case of non-arahats. These types
of vīthi-cittas perform the function of javana and they arise and fall
away in a succession of seven cittas. After these have fallen away there
are, if the object is very clear,[^128] tadālambana-cittas
arising in a succession of two cittas. 

Thus, there are only three types of vīthi-cittas arising
that experience an object through the mind-door. They are the adverting
vīthi-citta, the javana vīthi-citta, of which there are seven cittas in
succession, and the tadālambana or tadārammaṇa vīthi-citta, of which
there are two types in succession.

When we see what appears through the eyes, all
vīthi-cittas that arise in the eye-door process and experience visible
object through the eye-door are eye-door process cittas. Of these
vīthi-cittas, there are seven different types in all. They depend on the
eye-door and they experience the object that appears through the
eye-door, that has not yet fallen away. It is the same in the case of
the other sense-door processes. There are in each of these processes
seven different types of vīthi-cittas experiencing the object that
appears through the corresponding doorway and has not yet fallen away. 

The number of vīthi-cittas that experience objects in
sense-door processes can be different. Four different courses or rounds
(vāras) can be distinguished in sense-door processes:

1. the full course ending with the tadālambana-citta (tadālambana
 vāra); 

2. the course ending with the javana-citta (javana vāra); 

3. the course ending with the votthapana-citta (votthapana vāra); 

4. the futile course (mogha vāra).



A course, or vāra, is a series of vīthi-cittas that
arise and fall away in succession and experience the same object through
the same doorway. In some courses, seven types of vīthi-citta arise, in
others six types, in others again five types, and in some there are no
vīthi-cittas arising, there are only the atīta bhavanga and the bhavanga
calana. 

In the case of the futile course, when a rūpa impinges
on one of the senses, the bhavanga-citta that arises at that moment, the
atīta bhavanga, is not succeeded immediately by the bhavanga calana, the
vibrating bhavanga. There are several moments of atīta bhavanga arising
and falling away before the bhavanga calana, which is stirred by the
object, arises and this citta is then succeeded by several more moments
of bhavanga calana, arising and falling away. Since the object, which is
rūpa impinging on one of the senses, is about to fall away (lasting no
longer than seventeen moments of citta), there are no conditions for
vīthi-cittas to arise and to experience the object that impinged on one
of the senses. In that case, it is a futile course. 

The futile course of a process can be compared to the
situation when someone who is fast asleep and stirred in order to be
woken up, does not wake up, and who, when stirred again with force,
still does not wake up. In the case of the futile course, the
adverting-consciousness does not arise, there are only the atīta
bhavanga and the bhavanga calana. The object that impinges when there is
a futile course is called “very slight” (atiparitta), because it
impinges on one of the senses and only affects bhavanga-cittas, it does
not condition the arising of vīthi-cittas; it falls away before there is
an opportunity for their arising.

It may also happen that there are several types of atīta
bhavanga arising and falling away, followed by several types of bhavanga
calana arising and falling away and that after that the bhavangupaccheda
arises and the stream of bhavanga-cittas is arrested. Then, the
sense-door adverting-consciousness, one of the sense-cognitions, the
receiving-consciousness and the investigating-consciousness, can arise
and fall away in succession. After that, the determining-consciousness
arises, but since the rūpa cannot last longer than seventeen moments of
citta, there is no opportunity for the arising of the javana-cittas that
experience that rūpa. In that case, two or three moments of
votthapana-citta arise and fall away and then, when the rūpa falls away,
the process is ended. This course is called the course ending with
votthapana (votthapana vāra), since the votthapana-citta is the last
vīthi-citta. 

All this is according to reality as it occurs in daily
life. When an object impinges on one of the senses, the full course of
seven types of vīthi-cittas arising and falling away does not always
occur. It may happen that there are no vīthi-cittas, thus, there is a
futile course, or that the course ends with votthapana-citta (votthapana
vāra). In the last case, the object is called “slight” (paritta),
because it is the object of only five kinds of vīthi-cittas and then it
falls away.

It may also happen, when the votthapana-citta has arisen
and fallen away, and is succeeded by the javana-cittas, which arise and
fall away in a succession of seven cittas, that then the object falls
away. In such a case, the tadālambana vīthi-citta cannot arise and there
is a course ending with the javana-citta (javana vāra), with six kinds
of vīthi-cittas, where the last type is javana-citta experiencing the
object. The object of such a course is called “great” (mahanta), because
it is clear and it conditions the arising of kusala citta, akusala
citta, or, in the case of the arahat, mahā-kiriyacitta.

Lastly, it may happen that when the javana-cittas have
arisen and fallen away in a succession of seven cittas, that the object
has not yet fallen away. Then there is a condition for two types of
tadārammaṇa-citta (or tadālambana-citta) to arise and to experience the
object, which has not yet fallen away. The last vīthi-citta that
experiences the object is then tadālambana-citta. This is the course
ending with tadālambana-citta (tadālambana vāra). The object of such a
course is called “very great” (atimahanta). This object is very clear,
the process runs its full course with the tadālambana vīthi-cittas
succeeding the javana vīthi-cittas and experiencing the object, which
has not yet fallen away.

In the case of the mind-door process, two different
courses are possible: the course ending with javana and the course
ending with tadālamabana. The object of the course ending with javana is
called “obscure” (avibhūta), because it is less clear than the object of
the course ending with tadālambana. The object of the course ending with
tadālambana is called “clear” (vibhūta), because it is clearer than the
object of the course ending with javana. 

There are six doorways. A doorway is the means through
which vīthi-citta knows an object other than the object of the
bhavanga-citta. Of these six doorways, through which vīthi-cittas
experience objects, five doorways are rūpa and one is nāma. Summarizing
the six doorways, they are:

- the eye-door, cakkhu-dvāra, which is the cakkhuppasāda
 rūpa,[^129]
- the ear-door, sota-dvāra, which is the sotappasāda rūpa, 

- the nose-door, ghāṇa-dvāra, which is the ghāṇappassāda rūpa, 

- the tongue-door, jivhā-dvāra, which is the jivhāppasāda rūpa, 

- the body-door, kāya-dvāra, which is the kāyappassāda rūpa, 

- the mind-door, mano-dvāra, which is the bhavangupaccheda
 citta,[^130] preceding the mind-door
 adverting-consciousness. 



Six rūpas are bases, vatthus, where cittas arise, in the
planes of existence where there are five khandhas, nāma and rūpa. These
rūpas are called vatthu rūpa. Summarizing them, they are:

- the cakkhuppasāda rūpa, which is the eye-base, cakkhu-vatthu, the
 place of origin for the two types of seeing-consciousness,
 cakkhu-viññāṇa;

- the sotappasāda rūpa, which is the ear-base, sota-vatthu, for the
 two types of hearing-consciousness, sota-viññāṇa; 

- the ghāṇappassāda rūpa, which is the nose-base, ghāṇa-vatthu, for
 the two types of smelling-consciousness, ghāṇa-viññāṇa; 

- the jivhāppasāda rūpa, which is the tongue-base, jivhā-vatthu, for
 the two types of tasting-consciousness, jivhā-viññāṇa; 

- the kāyappassāda rūpa, which is the body-base, kāya-vatthu, for
 the two types of kāya-viññāṇa; 

- the hadaya-rūpa, the heart-base, which is the place of origin in
 the planes where there are five khandhas for all cittas other than
 the five pairs of sense-cognitions. 



The five pasāda rūpas can be doors as well as bases,
places of origin. The cakkhuppassāda rūpa (eyesense) is the eye-door for
all the cittas of the eye-door process, namely: eye-door
adverting-consciousness, seeing-consciousness, receiving-consciousness,
investigating-consciousness, determining-conscious-ness, javana-citta
and tadālambana-citta, experiencing visible object which impinges on the
eyesense and which has not yet fallen away. However, the cakkhuppasāda
rūpa is also the eye-base, cakkhu-vatthu, that is the place of origin,
only for the two types of seeing-consciousness (kusala vipākacitta and
akusala vipākacitta). With regard to the other cittas of the eye-door
process, the eye-door adverting-consciousness, the
receiving-consciousness, the investigating-consciousness, the
determining-consciousness, the javana-citta and the tadālambana-citta,
they arise at the heart-base, hadaya-vatthu. It is the same in the case
of the other pasāda rūpas that are the doors of the relevant
vīthi-cittas, but which are the base, vatthu, only for the corresponding
sense-cognitions. 

The hadaya rūpa is the base, the place of origin, for
the cittas concerned, but it is not a doorway.
