## The Factors Leading to Enlightenment

Defilements can be classified according to different
degrees; they can be subtle, medium or coarse defilements.

The coarse defilements, vītikkama kilesas,[269](#ftn269)
are the defilements that are the condition for committing akusala kamma
through the body or through speech. One can abstain from vītikkama
kilesa by the observance of sīla. 

The medium defilements, pariyuṭṭhāna
kilesas,[270](#ftn270) arise with the akusala citta that is not of the
degree of akusala kamma. They can be temporarily subdued by kusala
jhānacitta, and that is elimination by suppression, (vikkhambhana
pahāna)[271](#ftn271). 

The subtle defilements are the inherent tendencies,
anusaya kilesas.[272](#ftn272) So long as defilements have not been
completely eradicated, the anusaya kilesas lie dormant in the cittas
that arise and fall away in succession. They are like germs that
condition the arising of the medium defilements. Defilements cannot
arise again when they have been completely eradicated (samuccheda
pahāna)[273](#ftn273). When the lokuttara magga-citta realizes the noble
Truths and experiences nibbāna, anusaya kilesas are eradicated in
accordance with the stage of enlightenment that has been attained. They
are successively eradicated at the different stages of enlightenment. 

Before the Buddha’s enlightenment, people abstained from
akusala by the observance of sīla and they could, by the development of
samatha, temporarily subdue defilements (vikkhambhana pahāna). They
could cultivate samatha even to the highest stage of arūpa-jhāna, the
stage of “neither-perception-nor-non-perception.” However, nobody could
eradicate the inherent tendencies, the anusaya kilesas. The Buddha,
after he had accumulated the perfections (pāramīs) for four incalculable
periods of time and a hundred thousand aeons, attained Buddhahood and
thereby became the Sammāsambuddha, who is unsurpassed in wisdom. He
taught the way that should be followed to realize the ariyan Truths. 

There were many disciples who could realize the noble
Truths and eradicate defilements and thus, the ariyan
Sangha[274](#ftn274) came into being. From that time on, people could
study and apply the Dhamma, which the Buddha had realized when he
attained enlightenment, and which he taught in all details for
forty-five years. The Dhamma the Buddha taught is subtle, intricate and
deep in meaning. The Buddha taught the characteristics of all realities
he had penetrated at the time of his enlightenment. One should study and
investigate the Dhamma the Buddha taught in detail so as to have right
understanding of it. Otherwise, it will be impossible to develop the
paññā that can penetrate the true nature of realities and eradicate
defilements.

One should have right understanding of the Dhamma from
the beginning so that paññā can be developed which knows the
characteristics of realities as they are. From the beginning it should
be known precisely which dhammas paññā can penetrate: all that is
reality and that appears right now through the eyes, the ears, the nose,
the tongue, the bodysense and the mind-door.

Each moment when one sees, hears, smells, tastes,
experiences tangible object or thinks, there is bound to be ignorance of
the true nature of realities. The Buddha taught in all details about the
dhammas that arise and appear all day long, at each moment, through the
sense-doors and the mind-door. He taught the Dhamma so that we could see
the disadvantages of defilements and the danger of being in the cycle of
birth and death. So long as one does not see the danger of being in the
cycle of birth and death, there is no sense of urgency, no energy to
develop insight, vipassanā. Paññā developed in vipassanā sees the
characteristics of realities as they are naturally appearing in daily
life, and this kind of paññā can eradicate defilements. 

The development of samatha and the development of
vipassanā are different with different objectives and they are also
different as to the degree of paññā that develops them. In samatha,
mahā-kusala citta accompanied by paññā meditates on specific subjects so
that calm can be obtained and the citta is firmly concentrated on the
meditation subject. In vipassanā ultimate realities, paramattha dhammas,
are the objects of paññā. These are the nāma dhammas and rūpa dhammas
that arise and appear and then fall away. Mahā-kusala citta accompanied
by paññā can begin to notice and investigate one reality at a time, over
and over again. In that way it can gradually be realized that dhammas
are not a being, person or self. The result of the development of
samatha is rebirth in one of the brahma-planes. The result of the
development of vipassanā is paññā that knows realities as they are and
eradicates defilements. The lokuttara magga-citta has nibbāna as object
and eradicates defilements in accordance with the stage of enlightenment
that has been attained. When the stage of the arahat is attained, all
defilements are eradicated completely by the magga-citta; that means the
end to the cycle of birth and death, no more rebirth.

The person who develops vipassanā should be truthful
with regard to himself. He should realize that he still has all kinds of
defilements and he should not erroneously believe that lobha has to be
eradicated first of all; this would be impossible. Someone who is still
an ordinary person cannot pass over stages of development of
understanding and become an arahat immediately. First of all, the
clinging to “personality view” (sakkāya-diṭṭhi), by which one takes
realities for a “whole,” for self, being or person, should be completely
eradicated. After that, other defilements can be eradicated stage by
stage. If someone does not know that, while he is seeing, there is no
self, being or person, how could he eradicate defilements such as
attachment or aversion? It is the same with regard to the other
doorways. So long as there is personality view, defilements cannot be
eradicated.

Each reality that arises falls away very rapidly; it
vanishes completely. Realities arise and fall away all the time. The
Buddha taught the way to develop the paññā that knows the
characteristics of realities as they are. The development of the
eightfold Path is the one and only way to realize the truth. The factors
of the eightfold Path are the following cetasikas: right understanding
(sammā-diṭṭhi, paññā cetasika), right thinking (sammā-sankappa, vitakka
cetasika), right speech (sammā-vāca cetasika), right action
(sammā-kammanta cetasika), right livelihood (sammā-ājīva cetasika),
right effort (sammā-vāyāma, viriya cetasika), right mindfulness
(sammā-sati, sati cetasika) and right concentration (sammā-samādhi,
ekaggatā cetasika).

In the beginning, when lokuttara citta has not yet
arisen, the Path is still “worldly”, lokiya, not lokuttara. Then there
are usually five Path-factors performing their functions together, which
means that the citta is not accompanied by the three abstentions, virati
cetasikas, of right speech, right action and right livelihood. When
there is an opportunity to abstain from akusala, only one type of virati
arises at a time. Only at the moment of lokuttara citta the three virati
cetasikas arise together. The five Path-factors (apart from the virati
cetasikas) perform their functions together when there is awareness of a
characteristic of nāma or rūpa appearing through one of the six doors.
Paññā cetasika that arises together with sammā-sati gradually begins to
consider and to investigate the characteristics of nāma and rūpa. Paññā
has to consider realities very often, over and over again, so that it
can clearly discern whether it is a nāma or a rūpa that appears.

The realities, which appear through the eyes, the ears,
the nose, the tongue, the bodysense or the mind-door, can be classified
as the four Applications of Mindfulness, Satipaṭṭhānas. They are the
following:

1. Application of mindfulness of the body,
 kāyānupassanā[275](#ftn275) satipaṭṭhāna. When sati arises and is
 aware of a characteristic of a rūpa of the body, there is at such a
 moment kāyānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna. 
2. Application of mindfulness of feeling, vedanānupassanā
 satipaṭṭhāna. When sati arises and is aware of a characteristic of
 feeling that appears, there is at such a moment vedanānupassanā
 satipaṭṭhāna. 
3. Application of mindfulness of citta, cittānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna.
 When sati arises and is aware of a characteristic of one of the
 different types of citta, there is at such a moment cittanupassanā
 satipaṭṭhāna. 
4. Application of mindfulness of dhammas, dhammānupassanā
 satipaṭṭhāna. This application of mindfulness includes the realities
 classified under aspects other than those of the first three
 applications of mindfulness.[276](#ftn276) When sati arises and is
 aware of a dhamma included in this application of mindfulness, there
 is at such a moment dhammānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna. 

The word satipaṭṭhāna has three meanings:

1. The objects sati is aware of, thus, a paramattha dhamma, a nāma
 dhamma or a rūpa dhamma. These are classified as the four
 satipaṭṭhānas. 
2. Sati cetasika that arises together with kāmāvacara citta
 accompanied by paññā (ñāṇa-sampayutta), and which is aware of the
 objects of mindfulness, the four satipaṭṭhānas. 
3. The Teacher’s threefold surpassing of delight and aversion with
 regard to the disciples who apply his teaching, with regard to those
 who do not apply it, and with regard to those people some of whom
 apply it and some do not. This is the Path the Sammāsambuddha and
 the ariyan disciples have developed.[277](#ftn277)



The development of the ariyan eightfold Path is actually
the development of the four satipaṭṭhānas. It is the development of
awareness and right understanding of the characteristics of realities,
as they appear one at a time in our daily life, through the sense-doors
and through the mind-door. Mindfulness is not easy and in the beginning
it cannot often arise. The reason is that ignorance, clinging and all
the other akusala dhammas have been accumulated for an endlessly long
time in the cycle of birth and death. And also in this life, from the
time we were born, defilements have been accumulated each day. The
person who correctly understands cause and result of realities knows
that he needs great patience and perseverance so that he is able to
listen to the Dhamma, to study it carefully and to consider it. Only
thus can one have understanding of the realities that appear through the
eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the bodysense and the mind-door. 

By listening and considering, the right conditions are
being accumulated for the arising of satipaṭṭhāna, awareness and
investigation of the characteristics of the realities that are
appearing. In this way, realities can be known as they are. Through
awareness of realities, one will directly understand the truth in
conformity with what one has learnt and understood intellectually,
namely, that all dhammas, including satipaṭṭhāna and the factors of the
eightfold Path, are anattā, non-self. Satipaṭṭhāna can arise when there
are the right conditions, that is, when mahā-kusala citta accompanied by
paññā has arisen time and again, and paññā has thus been accumulated.
Then people will not deviate anymore from the right Path. They will not
follow a practice other than being aware of, noticing and considering
the nāma dhammas and the rūpa dhammas appearing through the six doors.

The person who develops paññā is truthful, sincere with
regard to his own development. When satipaṭṭhāna arises, he knows that
that moment is different from forgetfulness of realities. When
satipaṭṭhāna arises, there cannot yet immediately be clear understanding
of the characteristics of nāma and rūpa. Paññā develops only very
gradually. 

When sati of satipaṭṭhāna notices and considers the
characteristics of the nāmas and rūpas that appear, there is also right
effort arising together with sati. Right effort can be classified as
fourfold, as four sammāppadhānas, right efforts: the effort to avoid,
saṃvara-padhāna, the effort to overcome, pahāna-padhāna, the effort to
develop, bhāvanā-padhāna, and the effort to maintain,
anurakkhaṇa-padhāna.

Saṃvara-padhāna is the effort to avoid the arising of
akusala dhammas that have not arisen yet.

Pahāna-padhāna is the effort to overcome or eliminate
the akusala dhammas that have arisen.

Bhāvanā-padhāna is the effort to develop the kusala
dhammas that have not yet arisen.

Anurakkhaṇa-padhāna is the effort to maintain the kusala
dhammas that have arisen so that they will reach completion.

These four right efforts are the foundation for the
accomplishment of result, but there are other sobhana dhammas that have
to accompany them in order to reach the goal and among these are the
four “Roads to Power” or “Bases of Success,” iddhi-pādas.[278](#ftn278)
These are the following:

- The Basis of Success of chanda. This is chanda cetasika or
 wish-to-do. Chanda wishes to consider and to be aware of the
 characteristics of the nāmas and rūpas that are appearing, so that
 they can be known as they are. Chanda is compared to a royal
 attendant who is diligent in his service to the King. Even so is
 chanda a basis of accomplishment so that the right result can be
 reached.[279](#ftn279) 
- The Basis of Success of viriya. This is viriya cetasika or energy,
 energy to notice and consider the characteristics of the nāmas and
 rūpas that are appearing. By dependence on energy, the right result
 can be accomplished. Viriya is compared to a royal attendant who
 assists the King by his courage in the performance of his task. 
- The Basis of Success of citta. Through citta the right result can
 be achieved. Citta is compared to a royal attendant who gives
 assistance to the King by accomplishing his task well because of his
 natural good qualities. 
- The Basis of Success of vimaṃsā, investigation. This is paññā
 cetasika that carefully considers and investigates the
 characteristics of realities. By dependence on paññā, the right
 result can be achieved. Vimaṃsā is compared to a royal attendant who
 gives assistance to the King by his wisdom. 

Each of these royal attendants can, because of his own
natural capability, be a dependable support in the accomplishment of the
goal. Even so, the Bases of Success are a dependable support to reach
the right result.

The four Bases of Success have to depend on the five
“spiritual faculties,” indriyas, so that they can perform their
functions. These faculties have to be developed so that they can have a
leading function with regard to the development of the right Path. They
are the following:

- The faculty of confidence, which is saddhā cetasika. This is a
 leader when there is confidence in awareness of the characteristics
 of realities that are appearing. 
- The faculty of energy, which is viriya cetasika. This is a leader
 when there is energy and courage that prevents laziness and being
 disheartened with regard to awareness right now. It is energy for
 awareness of the characteristics of realities that are appearing. 
- The faculty of mindfulness, which is sati cetasika. It is a leader
 that prevents forgetfulness, it is mindful of the characteristics of
 realities which are appearing. 
- The faculty of concentration, samādhi, which is ekaggatā cetasika.
 It is a leader in focusing on the object that is appearing. 
- The faculty of wisdom, which is paññā cetasika. It is a leader in
 careful consideration, investigation and study of the
 characteristics of the realities that appear. 



When the five faculties have been developed, they become
powerful and unshakable. They do not vacillate with regard to their task
of considering whatever object appears. Then they can become “powers,”
balas. They are the following:

- The power of confidence, saddhā, which cannot be shaken by lack of
 confidence. 
- The power of energy, viriya, which cannot be shaken by
 discouragement. 
- The power of mindfulness, sati, which cannot be shaken by
 forgetfulness of the realities that appear. 
- The power of concentration, samādhi, which cannot be shaken by
 distraction with regard to the object that appears. 
- The power of wisdom, paññā, which cannot be shaken by ignorance. 



Saddhā, viriya, sati and samādhi can become strong when
paññā has become a power. When paññā thoroughly understands the
characteristics of nāma and rūpa, it has become unshakable; it does not
vacillate. When seeing appears, paññā can realize its characteristic as
nāma, the reality, the element that experiences. It is the same with
regard to hearing, smelling, tasting, the experience of tangible object
and thinking; these can be realized as nāma. 

When paññā accompanied by sati considers the
characteristics of nāma and rūpa over and over again, it becomes more
accomplished, so that different stages of insight, vipassanā ñāṇas, can
be reached. Then paññā is accompanied by the seven factors of
enlightenment, bojjhangas. These factors, which lead to the realization
of the noble Truths, are the following:

1. The enlightenment factor of mindfulness, sati cetasika. 
2. The enlightenment factor of investigation of Dhamma,
 dhamma-vicaya. This is paññā cetasika. 
3. The enlightenment factor of energy, viriya cetasika. 
4. The enlightenment factor of rapture, pīti cetasika. 
5. The enlightenment factor of calm, passaddhi. These are the
 cetasikas that are calm of cetasikas, kāya-passaddhi, and calm of
 citta, citta-passaddhi. 
6. The enlightenment factor of concentration, which is samādhi,
 ekaggatā cetasika. 
7. The enlightenment factor of equanimity, upekkhā, which is
 tatramajjhattatā cetasika. 

When paññā has become accomplished to the degree that it
can realize the noble Truths, it is accompanied by these seven factors
of enlightenment. Paññā reaches accomplishment by means of thirty-seven
dhammas pertaining to enlightenment, the bodhipakkhiya dhammas. These
are: the four applications of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the
four bases of success, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven
factors of enlightenment and the eight Path-factors.[280](#ftn280) 

The lokuttara citta is accompanied by all eight
Path-factors. These are the following cetasikas: sammā-diṭṭhi, right
view, sammā-sankappa, right thinking, sammā-vāca, right speech,
sammā-kammanta, right action, sammā-ājīva, right livelihood,
sammā-vāyāma, right effort, sammā-sati, right mindfulness, and
sammā-samādhi, right concentration. The lokuttara citta is accompanied
by all the dhammas pertaining to enlightenment, bodhipakkhiya dhammas,
when enlightenment is attained and nibbāna is experienced in a
mind-door process. That process runs as follows:

**bhavanga-cittas:**

bhavanga-cittas, vipākacittas which are
        ñāṇa-sampayutta1
bhavanga-calana, vibrating bhavanga,
        vipākacitta which is ñāṇa-sampayutta
bhavangupaccheda, arrest bhavanga,
        which is vipākacitta ñāṇa-sampayutta

**mind-door adverting-citta:**

manodvārāvajjana-citta which is kiriyacitta

**javana-cittas:**


parikamma (preparatory), mahā-kusala
        which is ñāṇa-sampayutta
upacāra (proximatory), mahā-kusala which 
        is ñāṇa-sampayutta (of the same type
        as parikamma)
anuloma (adaptation), mahā-kusala which
        is ñāṇa-sampayutta (of the same type
        as parikamma)
gotrabhū (change-of-lineage)1, mahā-kusala
        which is ñāṇa-sampayutta (of the same
        type as parikamma)
sotapatti magga-citta, lokuttara kusala citta
sotapatti phala-citta, lokuttara vipākacitta
sotapatti phala-citta, lokuttara vipākacitta

**bhavanga-citta:**

bhavanga-citta, which is vipākacitta
        ñāṇa-sampayutt



In the case of lokuttara jhāna,[283](#ftn283) the
lokuttara jhānacitta is accompanied by the jhāna-factors of the stage of
jhāna that was attained just before enlightenment. Thus, if there is
lokuttara jhānacitta accompanied by the factors of the second stage of
jhāna, vitakka cetasika, sammā-sankappa (right thinking) does not
arise.[284](#ftn284) If there is lokuttara jhānacitta accompanied by the
factors of the third stage of jhāna, vicāra cetasika (sustained
thinking) does not arise. If there is lokuttara jhānacitta accompanied
by the factors of the fourth stage of jhāna, pīti cetasika (rapture)
does not arise. If there is lokuttara jhānacitta accompanied by the
factors of the fifth stage of jhāna, there is upekkhā vedanā
(indifferent feeling), instead of somanassa (pleasant feeling).

A person who is keen (tikkha puggala) and realizes the
noble Truths rapidly, does not need parikamma (preparatory
consciousness) in the process during which magga-citta arises. Thus, in
that process there are upacāra (proximatory consciousness), anuloma
(adaptation), gotrabhū (change-of-lineage), magga-citta, and then,
instead of two moments of phala-citta, there are three moments of
phala-citta.[285](#ftn285) 

When the magga-vīthi-cittas have fallen away, there are
bhavanga-cittas arising and falling away, and then there are processes
of cittas reviewing the enlightenment that was attained (paccavekkhaṇa
vīthi). There are five different processes of reviewing ocurring one
after the other: the reviewing of the magga-citta, of the phala-citta,
of nibbāna, of the defilements that have been eradicated and of the
defilements that have not yet been eradicated. 

When the magga-vīthi-cittas of the different stages of
enlightenment have fallen away, they must be followed by processes of
reviewing. Thus, the ariyan does not have wrong understanding with
regard to his stage of enlightenment. The sotāpanna does not erroneously
believe that he is a sakadāgāmī (once-returner, who has attained the
second stage of enlightenment), and it is the same for the sakadāgāmī,
the anāgāmī (non-returner, who has attained the third stage of
enlightenment) and the arahat.

At the higher stages of enlightenment, following upon
the stage of the sotāpanna, there is in the process of enlightenment
instead of change-of-lineage, gotrabhū, “purification,” vodāna. The
reason is that the person who attains a higher stage of enlightenment is
no longer an ordinary person.
