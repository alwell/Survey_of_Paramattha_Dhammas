## The Nature of Vipāka


Vipāka is produced by kamma performed in the past. It is
not easy to understand that kamma, which already belongs to the past,
can still be a condition for the arising of vipākacitta and
vipākacetasikas in the present time. The nature of vipāka should be
examined in detail, so that there can be right understanding of kamma
and vipāka. The reality of vipāka is nāma, citta and cetasikas that
arise because they are conditioned by kamma that has been performed
already. 

When a person is confronted with an unpleasant or a
pleasant event in his life, people usually say, “This is his kamma.” We
should say that it is the result of kamma performed in the past, so that
people can have right understanding of kamma and vipāka. If one does not
express oneself precisely and, for example, says that an accident is the
kamma of that person, the truth of cause and result will not be clear to
other people who are not familiar with this subject. They will confuse
kamma and vipāka and take vipāka for kamma. 

When we consider the aspect of citta as vipāka,
conditioned by accumulated kamma and defilements, we shall see more
clearly the true nature of different dhammas. We should remember that
without the doorways of the senses and the mind-door, by means of which
objects are received and experienced, vipākacittas could not arise in
our daily life; the result of kamma could not be received. When seeing
arises, there is vipāka, the result of kamma. The result of kamma is
received not only when we have an accident, when we suffer from sickness
or pain, when we experience gain and loss, honour and dishonour. Also at
each moment of seeing, hearing or the other sense-cognitions, when we
experience the ordinary objects in daily life, there is result of kamma
performed in the past. Sati can be aware of the reality that is vipāka
when there is seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or the experience of
tangible object in daily life.

Vipākacitta is bound to arise; it is the result of kamma
that has been performed. We cannot know by which kamma in the past the
vipākacittas arising in the different processes are conditioned. For
example, we do not know which kamma produces the vipākacitta that hears
the sound of a child playing football. It is difficult to understand the
subject of kamma in detail. It is one of the subjects that are
“unthinkable,” subjects one cannot fathom, and therefore one should not
speculate about them.[162](#ftn162)

Kamma that has been performed already is a cause
stemming from the past. Even if kamma has been performed at a time that
lies far back in the cycle of birth and death, it can still condition
the arising of vipākacitta. If someone speculates about which kind of
kamma conditions as its result the seeing of this object or the hearing
of that sound, he will not be freed from ignorance and confusion. He
will be speculating about something he cannot fathom, because he does
not have paññā to the degree of penetrating the truth of kamma and
vipāka. Vipāka, however, the result of kamma, which experiences objects
through the senses, is appearing at this moment, and thus it can be
known.

Among the four “Applications of Mindfulness” the third
one is “Mindfulness of Citta.”[163](#ftn163) The first type of citta
mentioned in this section is citta with attachment (sarāgacitta). Sati
can arise and be aware of the characteristic of the citta with
attachment and clinging that appears time and again in daily life. If
sati does not arise, it will not be known that, when there is seeing of
an object, cittas with attachment and clinging to what is seen arise,
succeeding one another very rapidly. If paññā knows the characteristics
of dhammas that naturally appear, defilements can eventually be
eradicated. Paññā can know the difference between the characteristic of
vipākacitta, the result of past kamma, and the characteristic of kusala
citta and of akusala citta. Kusala citta and akusala citta of the degree
of kamma performed at the present time can condition the arising of
vipākacitta in the future. We should not only know the characteristic of
vipāka which is more obvious, such as in the case of a pleasant or an
unpleasant event, but also the characteristic of vipāka which is the
experience through the senses of the manifold objects in daily life.

If we understand that vipākacitta that arises is the
result of kamma we performed ourselves, can we still be angry with other
people or blame them for the vipāka we receive? In the Scriptures we
read about events in the lives of people of old who received different
vipākas. Also, in the present time different events occur which clearly
show that each person has to receive vipāka, the result of past kamma,
but we cannot predict in which way it will appear. For example, a
building may collapse and crush the owner so that he dies. A bomb is not
the cause that the building collapses and crushes that man. His death is
not caused by being shot or assaulted. Kamma performed in the past is
the cause for receiving results through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the
tongue or the bodysense. Therefore, one should not be angry with someone
else or blame him for the vipāka one receives. Sati can be aware of the
characteristic of the dhamma that is vipākacitta, not a being, person or
self. 

Thus, one can come to understand that the moment of
vipāka is the result of past kamma, different from the moments of
attachment, aversion and ignorance, or the moments of kusala dhammas.
The kusala dhammas and akusala dhammas that arise are causes in the
present that will condition the arising of results in the future.

The things outside as well as the rūpas of the body that
appear to seeing and are perceived as being tall, short, dark or light,
appear actually only at the moment they impinge on the eyesense. If
there is no eyesense and we do not see, we cannot think of shape and
form, of tall, short, dark and light we take for our body. 

Therefore, in reality, one’s own body and all the things
outside do not belong to anyone. They appear just at the moment
seeing-consciousness arises and then they fall away very rapidly.

It is the same with sound that only appears when it
impinges on the earsense, and then falls away completely. It does not
belong to anybody. By being aware of the characteristics of realities,
just as they naturally appear in daily life, the wrong view can be
eradicated which takes realities for a being, a person or self. 

In daily life there arises, time and again, just a
moment of seeing, of hearing, of smelling, of tasting, of
body-consciousness or of thinking, and all these passing moments are
real. They can be objects of satipaṭṭhāna so that paññā can investigate
their characteristics, and in this way realities can be known as they
are: not a being, person or self.

We should carefully consider what our possessions we
believe we own really are. The moments we do not see them we can merely
think about them, but we believe that we own many things. However, of
what use can these things be to us during the moments we do not see or
touch them? When the characteristics of paramattha dhammas have been
understood as they are: not a being, person or self, it will be realized
that paramattha dhammas are the same for all people, and that in that
respect all people are equal. When seeing-consciousness arises, it sees
what appears and then it falls away. The seeing-consciousness and what
appears to seeing, visible object, do not belong to anybody. Therefore,
we should not take anything for “I” or “mine.” All people are equal,
they are the same as far as paramattha dhammas are concerned. The
defilement, however, which takes realities for “I” or “mine” is of a
different degree for each person. 

We are used to enjoying our possessions, but we may
begin to realize that we have no possessions at all, that there is just
seeing-consciousness that arises and sees and then falls away very
rapidly. Where are our possessions at the moments seeing-consciousness
does not arise? Our possessions are only that which seeing-consciousness
sees when it arises just for a short moment, and therefore, is it right
to take what is seen for our possessions? What appears just for an
extremely short moment cannot become one’s property, it cannot be owned;
it can only appear through the eyes when it is impinging on the
eyesense. 

It is the same with sound, odour, flavour and tangible
object. They impinge just for a moment on the relevant sense-door and,
thus, we should not take these realities for “I” or “mine.” 

We all want to possess many things, we want to have as
much as other people, but it all depends on kamma; the vipāka which
appears in the present time is produced by a past cause. Therefore,
result or vipāka is not in anyone’s power. Nobody can predict which
kamma will produce which vipākacittas as result, arising in the
different processes when there is seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or
the experience of tangible object. 

In the “Gradual Sayings” (II, Book of the Fours, Ch
VIII, §7, Unthinkable) we read that the Buddha said:

> Monks, there are these four unthinkables, not to be thought of,
thinking of which one would be distraught and come to grief. What are
the four? 

> Of Buddhas, monks, the range (field of knowledge) is unthinkable, not to
be thought of... Of one who has attained jhāna, monks, the range of
jhāna is unthinkable, not to be thought of... The fruit of kamma, monks,
is unthinkable, not to be thought of... Speculation about the world,
monks, is unthinkable, not to be thought of, thinking of which one would
be distraught and would come to grief. These, monks, are the four
unthinkables...”

While we are seeing now, there is vipākacitta that
experiences an object through the eyes. Sati can be aware of the
characteristics of realities: of nāma, the reality which experiences an
object, and of rūpa, that which appears. Sati can only be aware of these
characteristics and more than that cannot be known. It cannot be known
which kamma of which past life has conditioned the seeing arising at
this moment as its result. It is impossible to find this out. When there
is seeing, sati can be mindful and paññā can clearly know the difference
between seeing, which is vipāka, and akusala citta with like or dislike
or kusala citta, which can arise after seeing.

The fourth aspect of citta as stated by the
“Atthasālinī” is its variegated nature (vicitta). Citta is variegated
because of the different accompanying dhammas, sampayutta dhammas,
namely, the cetasikas that arise together with the citta. The
accompanying cetasikas are different; each person has accumulated
different inclinations. It is impossible that each person thinks in the
same way or adheres to the same belief. People have a different outer
appearance and also their ways of thinking, their points of view and
their beliefs are not the same. Even the Buddha, during the time he was
still alive, before his parinibbāna, could not cause all people to have
right view. For those who have accumulated the right conditions, kusala
vipākacitta and kusala citta can arise, so that they are able to hear
the Dhamma, study it and investigate the truth the Buddha taught. When
one has listened to the Dhamma, one should test its meaning, carefully
consider it in all details and develop paññā so that the characteristics
of realities can be known as they really are, in conformity with the
truth the Buddha taught.

Wrong view does not only occur in other beliefs. Also,
those who are Buddhists engage in different practices depending on the
ideas and points of view they have accumulated. 

After the second Council (of Vesāli), the monks of the
Vajjiyan Clan, on account of whom the second Council had been convened,
propagated different doctrines in conformity with their own opinion. One
of their statements was that, in order to attain enlightenment, one
should merely recite:

> “Dukkha, dukkha” (“Kathāvatthu”, “Points of Controversy”, Nidānakathā).

Thus, we see that wrong understanding and wrong practice have occurred
since the past. We all should, in the present time, study the Dhamma and
investigate it in detail.

We read in the “Puggala Paññatti” (“Human Types”, Ch IV,
§5)[164](#ftn164) that with regard to the grasping of the Dhamma there
are four types of people: people who quickly grasp the Dhamma, can
realize the four noble Truths and attain enlightenment even during a
discourse (ugghaṭitaññū), people who attain enlightenment after a more
detailed explanation of a discourse that was uttered in brief
(vipacitaññū), people who require guidance and have to study and develop
paññā a great deal (neyya puggala), and people who, although they listen
to the Dhamma, read a great deal, often discuss and explain the Dhamma
to others, cannot attain enlightenment yet (pada parama)[165](#ftn165).
In the present time, there are no people of the first and second
category, there are only those of the third and fourth category. 

We all should study in order to know what the
realization of the four noble Truths means, and in what way paññā can be
developed that realizes the arising and falling away of the dhammas
appearing through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the
bodysense and the mind-door. Thus we shall know that the study of the
Dhamma is of great benefit, that it is a supporting condition for sati
to be aware of the characteristics of realities which the Buddha
penetrated by his enlightenment and which he, out of compassion, taught
to others in all details. The characteristic of citta, such as the citta
that sees, can be object of satipaṭṭhāna, since it is reality. Right
understanding can be developed of realities, so that the characteristic
of anattā, non-self, can be clearly known. Realities arise and fall away
in daily life, they are not a being, a person or self, not a thing that
exists.
