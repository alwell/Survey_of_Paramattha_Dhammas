## The Scriptures and Their Commentaries

The word of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Vinaya as taught by him,consists of nine divisions, which are Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākaraṇa, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhuta and Vedalla.[^8](#sdfootnote8sym)

1. *Sutta[^9](#sdfootnote9sym)* includes all Discourses, such as the Mangala sutta (Good Discourse, “Minor Readings”, V), and also the Vinaya Piṭaka[^10](#sdfootnote10sym) and the “Niddesa”.

2. *Geyya* includes all suttas with verses (*gāthā*), such as the
Sagāthā-vagga of the “Saṃyutta Nikāya”, or “Kindred Sayings” (I).

3. *Veyyākaraṇa*, or “Exposition”, includes the Abhidhamma Piṭaka, thesuttas without verses and the words of the Buddha that are not includedin the other eight divisions.

4. *Gāthā* or “Verses” include the “Dhammapada”, “Theragāthā”, “Therīgāthā”
(“Psalms of the Brothers and Sisters”) and those parts of the “Sutta-Nipāta” not called Sutta and entirely in verse.

5. *Udāna* or “Verses of Uplift” include eighty-two suttas connected with verses recited by the Buddha, inspired by knowledge and joy.

6. *Itivuttaka* or “As it was said” includes one hundred ten suttas[^11](#sdfootnote11sym) beginning with “Thus it was said by the Blessed One” (in Pāli: “*Vuttaṃ h’etaṃ Bhagavatā*”).

7. *Jātaka* or Birth Stories include five hundred fifty stories of the past lives of the Buddha and his disciples, beginning with the Apaṇṇaka Jātaka.

8. *Abbhuta*, “Marvellous,” includes suttas connected with wonderful and marvellous things (*dhammas* with extraordinary qualities, which are amazing).

9. *Vedalla* includes suttas with questions and answers that have as result understanding and delight, such as the Cullavedalla sutta.

The word of the Buddha consists of eighty-four thousand units of text.
The venerable Ānanda learnt eighty-two thousand units of text from the
Exalted One, and two thousand units of text from the bhikkhus, mainly
from the venerable Sāriputta. Each theme is one unit of text. Thus, the
sutta containing one theme is one unit of text. Where there are
questions and answers, each question forms one unit of text and each
answer forms one unit of text.

When the scriptures are classified as the Tipiṭaka, they are classified
as threefold, namely: the Vinaya, the Suttanta and the Abhidhamma.

The Vinaya Piṭaka or “Books of Discipline” consist of five Books,
namely: 

The commentary that explains the Vinaya is the
“Samantapāsādikā”.[^13](#sdfootnote13sym)

The Suttanta Piṭaka, or Discourses, consists of five
Nikāyas,[^14](#sdfootnote14sym) namely: 

1. “Dīgha Nikāya” or “Dialogues of
the Buddha,”[^15](#sdfootnote15sym) 

2. “Majjhima Nikāya” or “Middle Length
Sayings,”[^16](#sdfootnote16sym) 

3. “Saṃyutta Nikāya” or “Kindred
Sayings,”[^17](#sdfootnote17sym) 

4. “Aṅguttara Nikāya” or “Gradual
Sayings,”[^18](#sdfootnote18sym) 

5. “Khuddaka Nikāya” or “The Minor
Collection.”[^19](#sdfootnote19sym)

The “Dīgha Nikāya” is a collection of long dialogues (*dīgha* means
long), consisting of thirty-four suttas. This collection is divided into
three sections (in Pāli: *vagga*):[^20](#sdfootnote20sym)

The commentary to this collection is the “Sumaṅgalavilāsinī”.

The “Majjhima Nikāya” is a collection of suttas of medium length
(*majjhima* means middle), and it consists of one hundred fifty-two
suttas. It is divided into three parts, which are called in Pāli
“*paṇṇāsa*,” meaning fifty. The first two parts consist of fifty suttas
each and the third part of fifty-two suttas. They are called:

The commentary to this collection is the “Papañcasūdanī”.

The “Saṃyutta Nikāya” is a group of suttas (*saṃyutta* means joined,
connected) divided into five main divisions, namely:

The commentary to this collection is the “Sāratthappakāsinī”.

The “Aṅguttara Nikāya” consists of suttas grouped according to the
numbers of Dhamma subjects or points dealt with. They are arranged in
order, from one to eleven. Thus, there are eleven “*nipāta*,” or
sections in all. “Book of the Ones” consists of suttas dealing with one
kind of subject, and so on up to the Book of the Elevens. Summarizing
them, they are:

The commentary to the “Aṅguttara Nikāya” is the “Manorathapūranī”.

Apart from these four Nikāyas, there is the “Khuddaka Nikāya”, which
contains the word of the Buddha. This consists of the following books:

The commentaries to these collections of the “Khuddaka Nikāya” are the
following:


The Abhidhamma Piṭaka consists of the following seven Books:

-     

-      

As to the commentary to the last five Books of the Abhidhamma, this is
the “Pañcappakaraṇatthakathā”.[^31](#sdfootnote31sym)

The greater part of the commentaries to the Tipiṭaka is from the hand of
the great commentator Buddhaghosa.[^32](#sdfootnote32sym) He translated
into Pāli, compiled and arranged material from the ancient commentaries,
which were in Sinhalese. These commentaries, the “Mahā-Atthakathā”, the
“Mahā-Paccarī” and the “Kuruṇḍi”, stemmed from the time of the Thera
Mahinda, the son of the great King Asoka who came to Sri Lanka in order
to propagate Buddhism.

Furthermore, there are sub-commentaries, called *ṭīkā* in Pāli, which
explain the commentaries. These are the “Sāratthadīpanī”, a
sub-commentary to the “Samantapāsādikā”, which is the commentary to the
Vinaya; the “Sārattha Mañjūsā”, a sub-commentary to the Suttanta Piṭaka,
the “Paramatthapakāsinī”, a sub-commentary to the Abhidhamma Piṭaka; and
the anuṭīkā (*anu* meaning: along, alongside), which explains words and
expressions in the sub-commentaries. Apart from the aforementioned
works, there are several other texts in Buddhism needed for the study of
the Dhamma that were composed by the “Elders”[^33](#sdfootnote33sym)
who were qualified to pass on the tradition of the Dhamma. These are the
following texts:
