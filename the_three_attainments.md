## The Three Attainments

There are three attainments or samāpattis:[^319]

- attainment of jhāna, jhāna-samāpatti, 
- fruition attainment, phala-samāpatti, 
- attainment of extinction, nirodha-samāpatti. 

An ordinary person who is not an ariyan may attain jhāna
and acquire the skills, vasīs, in jhāna, such as attaining jhāna and
emerging from it in the order of the successive stages of jhāna. Someone
who is proficient in jhāna[^320] can

have jhāna-samāpatti, that is, jhānacittas arising in succession in a
mind-door process without bhavanga-cittas in between, for a period
lasting as long as he has determined. During that time, he is free from
pain and unhappiness. This is because he is free from the sense objects
and experiences only the meditation subject of jhāna, which conditions
the happiness of true calm. 

The ariyan who has developed jhāna and attained
enlightenment with lokuttara cittas accompanied by jhāna factors of the
different stages of jhāna can, after these cittas have fallen away,
attain fruition-attainment, phala-samāpatti, again during his life. For
him there can be other processes where phalacittas accompanied by jhāna
factors of the first, second, third, fourth or fifth stage of jhāna
experience nibbāna again. It depends on the stage of enlightenment he
has attained what type of phala-citta arises accompanied by jhāna
factors of one of the stages of jhāna. When there is
fruition-attainment, phala-cittas can arise in succession without
bhavanga-cittas in between, for a period lasting as long as he has
determined. 

In the mind-door process of cittas with
fruition-attainment, the kāmāvacara cittas (cittas of the sense sphere)
that arise first are not parikamma, preparatory consciousness, and
upacāra, access, but there are three moments of adaptation or
conformity, anuloma, because these cittas adapt or conform to the
phalacitta, which is lokuttara jhānacitta and which arises again,
experiencing nibbāna. These moments are different from parikamma,
upacāra and anuloma which arose in the magga-vīthi where the magga-citta
arose and eradicated defilements. In the case of fruition attainment
phala-citta arises and experiences nibbāna for a period lasting as long
as that person has determined.

The anāgāmī and the arahat who have attained the fourth
arūpa-jhāna, the stage of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception,[^321] can attain
cessation, nirodha-samāpatti. This is the attainment of the temporary
cessation of citta and cetasikas. They do not arise anymore, but this
stage cannot last longer than seven days. The reason is that food that
has been taken cannot support the body longer than seven days. The
temporary cessation of citta and cetasika is conditioned by two powers:
by samatha and by vipassanā. The anāgāmī and the arahat who have not
attained calm to the degree of the fourth arūpa-jhāna cannot attain
cessation. Neither can the sotāpanna and the sakadāgāmī attain
cessation, even if they have reached the fourth stage of
arūpa-jhāna.[^322] 

Those who are able to attain cessation should first
attain successively all the stages of rūpa-jhāna. They should emerge
from each stage and then investigate with insight saṅkhāra dhammas,
conditioned dhammas, as impermanent, dukkha and anattā, before they
attain the following stage of jhāna. When they have emerged from the
third stage of arūpa-jhāna, the sphere of nothingness, however, they
should first advert to a fourfold preparatory task (“Visuddhimagga” Ch
XXIII, 34): non-damage to others’ property; the community’s waiting; the
Master’s summons; the limit of duration.

As regards non-damage to others’ property, this refers
to what a bhikkhu uses or keeps, and what are not his personal property
but the property of others, such as bowl, robes, bed and dwelling. He
should resolve that such property will not be damaged, that it will not
be destroyed by fire, water, wind, thieves and so on within the period
of cessation-attainment, which lasts no longer than seven days. He does
not have to make a specific resolution with regard to his personal
property, such as his inner robes and outer robes, or his seat. These
are protected from damage or loss by the attainment of cessation itself.


As regards the Master’s summons, he should resolve to
emerge from cessation when the Buddha requires his presence.

As regards the limit of duration, he should know whether
his life will last longer than seven days or not. During the period of
cessation, the dying-consciousness cannot arise. Thus, when his lifespan
is not due to end within seven days he can enter cessation.

When a bhikkhu has done the fourfold preparatory task,
he can attain the fourth stage of arūpa-jhāna. After two moments of
arūpa-jhānacittas of that stage, which arise in that process, he
achieves cessation of citta and cetasika. They do not arise anymore and
this state can last for seven days. When he emerges from cessation, one
moment of phala-citta arises, to be followed by bhavanga-cittas. The
attainment of cessation can occur only in the planes where there are
five khandhas. It cannot occur in the arūpa-brahma planes where
rūpa-jhānacitta does not arise.[^323]
